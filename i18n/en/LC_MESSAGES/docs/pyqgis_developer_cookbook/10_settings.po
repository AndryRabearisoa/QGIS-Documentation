"These variables can be saved a retrieved with help of Qt and QGIS API. For "
"each variable, you should pick a key that will be used to access the "
"variable --- for user's favourite color you could use key \"favourite_color"
"\" or any other meaningful string. It is recommended to give some structure "

"**global settings** --- they are bound to the user at particular machine. "
"QGIS itself stores a lot of global settings, for example, main window size "
"or default snapping tolerance. This functionality is provided directly by Qt "
"framework by the means of QSettings class. By default, this class stores "
"settings in system's \"native\" way of storing settings, that is --- "
"registry (on Windows), .plist file (on Mac OS X) or .ini file (on Unix). The "
"`QSettings documentation <http://doc.qt.nokia.com/stable/qsettings.html>`_ "
"is comprehensive, so we will provide just a simple example::"

"Qt uses QVariant instances for variable values in setValue() and value() "

"instances, however the conversion from QVariant to Python is not automatic: "
"that's why we use the to*() methods. Few more things to note here:"

"in project file, so if the user opens the project again, the layer-related "

"v1.4. The API is similar to QSettings --- it takes and returns QVariant "
