msgid "The Quantum GIS project holds twice-yearly developer meetings, typically somewhere in Europe. The purpose of the meetings is to provide face-to-face time for developers. It is a forum for presenting new ideas, planning, putting heads together to solve problems and so on. We use funding from our :doc:`../sponsorship/index` to facilitate the event, with co-funding from the host who usually supplies the venue and the infrastructure for hosting the meeting. Individual developers also co-fund the event by donating their time and in many cases financially supporting their visit to the meeting directly."

However with increased funding through donations and our sponsorship programme, and a desire to promote new developers to get involved in the project, this policy has been updated as described below."
