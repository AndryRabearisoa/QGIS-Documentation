"The Quantum GIS project holds twice-yearly developer meetings, typically "
"somewhere in Europe. The purpose of the meetings is to provide face-to-face "
"time for developers. It is a forum for presenting new ideas, planning, "
"putting heads together to solve problems and so on. We use funding from our :"
"doc:`../sponsorship/index` to facilitate the event, with co-funding from the "
"host who usually supplies the venue and the infrastructure for hosting the "
"meeting. Individual developers also co-fund the event by donating their time "
"and in many cases financially supporting their visit to the meeting directly."

"'core' committers and community members of the project. However with "
"increased funding through donations and our sponsorship programme, and a "
"desire to promote new developers to get involved in the project, this policy "
"has been updated as described below."
