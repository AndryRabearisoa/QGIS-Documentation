"In recent years, the OpenStreetMap project has gained popularity because in "
"many countries no free geodata such as digital roadmaps are available. The "
"objective of the OSM project is to create a free editable map of the world "
"from GPS data, aerial photography or from local knowledge. To support this "
"objective, QGIS provides a plugin that enables its users to work with OSM "
