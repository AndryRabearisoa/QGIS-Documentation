Currently, SAGA, GRASS, OTB(Orfeo Toolbox) and R are supported, along with some other command-line applications that provide spatial data analysis functionalities. This chapter will show you how to configure SEXTANTE to include these additional applications. Once you have correctly configured the system, you will be able to execute external algorithms from any SEXTANTE component like the toolbox or the graphical modeler, just like you do with any other SEXTANTE geoalgorithm."

msgid "When using an external software, opening a file in QGIS does not mean that it can be opened and processed as well on that other software. In most cases, it can read what you have opened in QGIS, but in some cases, that might not be the case. When using databases or uncommon file formats, whether for raster of vector layers, problems might arise. If that happens, try to use well known file formats that you are sure that are understood by both programs, and check to console output (in the history and log dialog) for knowing more about what is going wrong."

Please note that OTB binaries are not included in SEXTANTE, so you have to download and install the software yourself. Please check the OTB website for more information."

However, if you try to run the algorithm after entering the parameter values, SEXTANTE will show an error message. This is because the algorithm descriptions (needed to create the parameters dialog and give SEXTANTE the information it needs about the algorithm) are not included with OTB, but with SEXTANTE instead. That is, they are part of SEXTANTE, so you have them in your installation even if you have not installed OTB. Running the algorithm, however, needs OTB binaries installed in your system."
