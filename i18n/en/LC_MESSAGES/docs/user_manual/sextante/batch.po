"SEXTANTE algorithms (including models) can be executed as a batch process. "
"That is, they can be executed using not a single set of inputs, but several "
"of them, executing the algorithm as many times as needed. This is useful "
"when processing large amounts of data, since it is not necessary to launch "
"the algorithm many times from the toolbox."

"Executing a batch process is similar to performing a single execution of an "
"algorithm. Parameter values have to be defined, but in this case we need not "
"just a single value for each parameter, but a set of them instead, one for "
"each time the algorithm has to be executed. Values are introduced using a "
"table like the one shown next."

"Each line of this table represents a single execution of the algorithm, and "

"The main differences are found for parameters representing layers or tables, "
"and for output filepaths. Regarding input layers and tables, when an "
"algorithm is executed as part of a batch process those input data objects "
"are taken directly from files, and not from the set of them already opened "
"in QGIS. For this reason, any algorithm can be executed as a batch process "
"even if no data objects at all are opened and the algorithm cannot be run "
"from the toolbox."

"Filenames for input data objects are introduced directly typing or, more "
"conveniently, clicking on the button on the right hand of the cell, which "
"shows a typical file chooser dialog. Multiple files can be selected at once. "
"If the input parameter represents a single data object and several files are "
"selected, each one of them will be put in a separate row, adding new ones if "
"needed. If it represents a multiple input, all the selected files will be "
"added to a single cell, separated by semicolons."
