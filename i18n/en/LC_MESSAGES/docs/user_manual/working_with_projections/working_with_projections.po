"QGIS allows users to define a global and project-wide CRS (Coordinate "
"Reference System) for layers without a pre-defined CRS. It also allows the "
"user to define custom coordinate reference systems and supports on-the-fly "
"(OTF) projection of vector and raster layers. All these features allow the "

"In order to use OTF projection, your data must contain information about its "
"coordinate reference system or you have to define a global, layer or project-"
"wide CRS. For PostGIS layers QGIS uses the spatial reference identifier that "
"was specified when the layer was created. For data supported by OGR, QGIS "
"relies on the presence of a recognized means of specifying the CRS. In the "
"case of shapefiles, this means a file containing the Well Known Text (:index:"
"`WKT`) specification of the CRS. This projection file has the same base name "
"as the shapefile and a prj extension. For example, a shapefile named :file:"
"`alaska.shp` would have a corresponding projection file named :file:`alaska."
