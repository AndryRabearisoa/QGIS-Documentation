msgid "The **[Advanced search...]** button opens the Query Builder and allows you to define a subset of a table using a SQL-like WHERE clause, display the result in the main window and save it as a Shapefile. For example, if you have a ``towns`` layer with a ``population`` field you could select only larger towns by entering ``population > 100000`` in the SQL box of the query builder. Figure_attributes_2_ shows an example of the query builder populated with data from a PostGIS layer with attributes stored in PostgreSQL. The Fields, Values and Operators sections help the user to construct the SQL-like query."

msgid "The **Fields list** contains all attributes of the attribute table to be searched. To add an attribute to the SQL where clause field, double click its name in the Fields list. Generally you can use the various fields, values and operators to construct the query or you can just type it into the SQL box."

In the above section the purpose of the query builder is to only show features meeting the filter criteria as a 'virtual layer' / subset. The purpose of the select by query function is to highlight all features that meet a particular criteria. Select by query can be used with all vector data providers."
