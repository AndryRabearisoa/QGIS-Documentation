"The :menuselection:`Raster Calculator` in the :menuselection:`Layer` menu "
"(see figure_raster_2_) allows to perform calculations on basis of existing "
"raster pixel values. The results are written to a new raster layer with a "
"GDAL supported format."

"The **Fields list** contains all loaded raster layers that can be used. To "
"add a raster to the raster calculator expression field, double click its "
"name in the Fields list. You can then use the operators to construct "
"calculation expressions or you can just type it into the box."

"In the **Result layer** section you have to define an output layer. You can "
"then define the extent of the calculation area based on an input raster "
"layer or based on X,Y coordinates and on Columns and Rows to set the "
"resolution of the output layer. If the input layer has a different "
"resolution, the values will be resampled with nearest neighbor algorithm."
