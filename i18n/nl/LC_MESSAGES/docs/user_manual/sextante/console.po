"The console allows advanced users to increase their productivity and perform "
"complex operations that cannot be performed using any of the other elements "
"of the SEXTANTE GUI. Models involving several algorithms can be defined "
"using the command-line interface, and additional operations such as loops "

"``runalg()`` method, which takes the name of the algorithm to execute as its "
"first parameter, and then a variable number of additional parameter "
"depending on the requirements of the algorithm. So the first thing you need "
"to know is the name of the algorithm to execute. That is not the name you "
"see in the toolbox, but rather a unique commandâ€“line name. To find the right "
"name for your algorithm, you can use the ``algslist()`` method. Type the "
