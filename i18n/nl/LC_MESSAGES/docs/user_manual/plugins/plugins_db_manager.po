"The DB Manager Plugin is officially part of |qg| core and intends to replace "
"the SPIT Plugin and the PostGIS Manager Plugin and additionally to integrate "
"all other database formats supported by |qg| in one user interface. The |"
"icon_dbmanager| :sup:`DB Manager` Plugin provides several features. You can "
"drag layers from the QGIS Browser into the DB Manager and it will import "
"your layer into your spatial database. You can drag and drop tables between "
"spatial databases and they will get imported. You can also use the DB "
"Manager to execute SQL queries against your spatial database and then view "
"the spatial output for queries by adding the results to QGIS as a query "
"layer."

"The [**Database**] menu allows to connect to an existing database, to start "
"the SQL-window and to exit the DB Manager Plugin. The **Schema** menu "
"includes tools to create and delete (empty) schemas and, if topology is "
"available (e.g. PostGIS 2) to start a TopoViewer. The menu [**Table**] "
"allows to create and edit tables and to delete tables and views. It is also "
"possible to empty tables and to move tables from one to another schema. "
"Finally you can also run Vacuum Analyze and add Versioning Support to a "
"table."

"If connected to a database, the **main window** of the DB Manager offers "
"three tabs. The **Info** tab provides information about the table and its "
"geometry as well as about existing Fields, Constraints and Indexes. It also "
"allows to run Vacuum Analyze and to create a spatial index on a selected "
"table, if not already done. The **Table** tab shows all attributes and the "
"**Preview** tab renders the geometries as preview."
