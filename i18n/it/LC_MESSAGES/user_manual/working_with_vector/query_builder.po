"The **[Advanced search...]** button opens the Query Builder and allows you "
"to define a subset of a table using a SQL-like WHERE clause, display the "
"result in the main window and save it as a Shapefile. For example, if you "
"have a ``towns`` layer with a ``population`` field you could select only "
"larger towns by entering ``population > 100000`` in the SQL box of the query "
"builder. Figure_attributes_2_ shows an example of the query builder "
"populated with data from a PostGIS layer with attributes stored in "
"PostgreSQL. The Fields, Values and Operators sections help the user to "
"construct the SQL-like query."
