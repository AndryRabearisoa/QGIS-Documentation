"GPS, the Global Positioning System, is a satellite-based system that allows "
"anyone with a GPS receiver to find their exact position anywhere in the "
"world. It is used as an aid in navigation, for example in airplanes, in "
"boats and by hikers.  The GPS receiver uses the signals from the satellites "
"to calculate its latitude, longitude and (sometimes) elevation.  Most "
"receivers also have the capability to store locations (known as "
"*waypoints*), sequences of locations that make up a planned *route* and a "
"tracklog or *track* of the receivers movement over time.  Waypoints, routes "
"and tracks are the three basic feature types in GPS data.  QGIS displays "
"waypoints in point layers while routes and tracks are displayed in "
"linestring layers."

"There are dozens of different file formats for storing GPS data. The format "

"Since QGIS uses GPX files you need a way to convert other GPS file formats "
"to GPX. This can be done for many formats using the free program GPSBabel, "
"which is available at http://www.gpsbabel.org.  This program can also "
"transfer GPS data between your computer and a GPS device.  QGIS uses "
"GPSBabel to do these things, so it is recommended that you install it.  "
"However, if you just want to load GPS data from GPX files you will not need "
"it. Version 1.2.3 of GPSBabel is known to work with QGIS, but you should be "
"able to use later versions without any problems."
