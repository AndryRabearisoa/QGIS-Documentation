msgid "GPS, the Global Positioning System, is a satellite-based system that allows anyone with a GPS receiver to find their exact position anywhere in the world. It is used as an aid in navigation, for example in airplanes, in boats and by hikers.  The GPS receiver uses the signals from the satellites to calculate its latitude, longitude and (sometimes) elevation.  Most receivers also have the capability to store locations (known as *waypoints*), sequences of locations that make up a planned *route* and a tracklog or *track* of the receivers movement over time.  Waypoints, routes and tracks are the three basic feature types in GPS data.  QGIS displays waypoints in point layers while routes and tracks are displayed in linestring layers."

msgid "Since QGIS uses GPX files you need a way to convert other GPS file formats to GPX. This can be done for many formats using the free program GPSBabel, which is available at http://www.gpsbabel.org.  This program can also transfer GPS data between your computer and a GPS device.  QGIS uses GPSBabel to do these things, so it is recommended that you install it.  However, if you just want to load GPS data from GPX files you will not need it. Version 1.2.3 of GPSBabel is known to work with QGIS, but you should be able to use later versions without any problems."
