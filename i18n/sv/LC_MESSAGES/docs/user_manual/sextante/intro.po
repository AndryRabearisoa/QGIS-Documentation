"This chapter introduces SEXTANTE, the powerful geospatial analysis framework "
"of QGIS. SEXTANTE is a geoprocessing environment that can be used to call "
"native and third party algorithms from QGIS, making your spatial analysis "
"tasks more productive and easy to accomplish."

"There are four basic elements in the SEXTANTE GUI, which are used to run "
"SEXTANTE algorithms for different purposes. Choosing one tool or another "
"will depend on the kind of analysis that is to be performed and the "
"particular characteristics of each user and project. All of them (except for "
"the batch processing interface, which is called from the toolbox, as we will "
"see) can be accessed from the *SEXTANTE* menu item (you will see more than "
"four entries. The remaining ones are not used to execute algorithms and will "
"be explained later in this chapter)."
