"As a roads layer you can use any polyline vector layer in any QGIS supported "
"format. Two lines with a common point are considered connected. Please note, "
"it is required to use layer CRS as project CRS while editing roads layer. "
"This is due to the fact that recalculation of the coordinates between "
"different CRS introduce some errors that can result in discontinuities, even "
"when 'snapping' is used."
