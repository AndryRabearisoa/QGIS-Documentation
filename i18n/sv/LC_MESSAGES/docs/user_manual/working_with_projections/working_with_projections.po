"QGIS allows users to define a global and project-wide CRS (Coordinate "
"Reference System) for layers without a pre-defined CRS. It also allows the "
"user to define custom coordinate reference systems and supports on-the-fly "
"(OTF) projection of vector and raster layers. All these features allow the "
"user to display layers with different CRS and have them overlay properly."

"In order to use OTF projection, your data must contain information about its "

"relies on the presence of a recognized means of specifying the CRS. In the "
"case of shapefiles, this means a file containing the Well Known Text (:index:"
