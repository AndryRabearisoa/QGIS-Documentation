"The GRASS plugin in QGIS is designed for users who are new to GRASS, and not "
"familiar with all the modules and options. As such, some modules in the "
"toolbox do not show all the options available, and some modules do not "
"appear at all. The GRASS shell (or console) gives the user access to those "
"additional GRASS modules that do not appear in the toolbox tree, and also to "
"some additional options to the modules that are in the toolbox with the "
"simplest default parameters. This example demonstrates the use of an "
"additional option in the **r.shaded.relief** module that was shown above."
