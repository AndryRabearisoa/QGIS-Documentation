"GIS is a relatively new field - it started in the 1970's. It used to be that "
"computerised GIS was only available to companies and universities that had "
"expensive computer equipment. These days, anyone with a personal computer or "
"laptop can use GIS software. Over time GIS Applications have also become "
"easier to use – it used to require a lot of training to use a GIS "
"Application, but now it is much easier to get started in GIS even for "
"amateurs and casual users. As we described above, GIS is more than just "
