"GIS is becoming an increasingly important tool in environmental management, "
"retail, military, police, tourism and many other spheres of our daily lives. "
"If you use a computer or a cell phone, you have probably already used a GIS "
"in some form without even realising it. Maybe it was a map on a web site, "
"Google Earth, an information booth or your cell phone telling you where you "
"are. Proprietary GIS software (software that cannot be freely shared or "
"modified) is available that will let you do everything we describe in these "
"worksheets and a lot more. However this software is usually very expensive "
"or otherwise limits your freedom to copy, share and modify the software. GIS "
"vendors sometimes make an exception for educational activities, providing "
"cheaper or free copies of their software. They do this knowing that if "
"teachers and learners get to know their software, they will be reluctant to "
"learn other packages. When learners leave school they will go into the "
"workplace and buy the commercial software, never knowing that there are free "
"alternatives that they could be using."
