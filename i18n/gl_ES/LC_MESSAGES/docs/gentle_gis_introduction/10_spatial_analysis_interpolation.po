"Weighting is assigned to sample points through the use of a weighting "

"TIN interpolation is another popular tool in GIS. A common TIN algorithm is "
"called **Delaunay** triangulation. It tries to create a surface formed by "
"triangles of nearest neighbour points. To do this, circumcircles around "
"selected sample points are created and their intersections are connected to "
"a network of non overlapping and as compact as possible triangles (see  )."

"The main disadvantage of the TIN interpolation is that the surfaces are not "
"smooth and may give a jagged appearance. This is caused by discontinuous "
"slopes at the triangle edges and sample data points. In addition, "
"triangulation is generally not suitable for extrapolation beyond the area "
"with collected sample data points (see  )."
