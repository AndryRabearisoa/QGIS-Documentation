"The *graphical modeler* allows to create complex models using a simple and "
"easy-to-use interface. When working with a GIS, most analysis operations are "
"not isolated, but part of a chain of operations instead. Using the graphical "
"modeler, that chain of processes can be wrapped into a single process, so it "
"is easier and more convenient to execute than a single process later on a "
"different set on inputs. No matter how many steps and different algorithms "
"it involves, a model is executed as a single algorithm, thus saving time and "
"effort, specially for larger models."
