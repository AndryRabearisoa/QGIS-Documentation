"Every time you execute a SEXTANTE algorithm, information about the process "
"is stored in the SEXTANTE history manager. Along with the parameters used, "
"the date and time of the execution are also saved."

"The SEXTANTE history manager is a set of registry entries grouped according "
"to their date of execution, making it easier to find information about an "
"algorithm executed at any particular moment."

"Process information is kept as a command-line expression, even if the "
"algorithm was launched from the toolbox. This makes it also useful for those "
"learning how to use the command-line interface, since they can call an "
"algorithm using the toolbox and then check the history manager to see how "
"that same algorithm could be called from the command line."

"Along with algorithm executions, SEXTANTE communicates with the user using "
"the other groups of the registry, namely *Errors, Warnings* and "
"*Information*. In case something is not working properly, having a look at "
"the *Errors* might help you to see what is happening. If you get in contact "
"with a SEXTANTE developer to report a bug or error, the information in that "
"group will be very useful for him to find out what is going wrong."

"When executing third party algorithms, this is usually done calling their "
"command-line interfaces, which communicate with the user using the console. "
"Although that console is not shown, a full dump of it is stored in the "
"*Information* group each time you run one of those algorithms. If, for "
"instance, you are having problems executing a SAGA algorithm, look for an "
"entry name *SAGA execution console output* to check all the messages "
"generated by SAGA and try to find out where the problem is."

"Some algorithms, even if they can produce a result with the given input "
