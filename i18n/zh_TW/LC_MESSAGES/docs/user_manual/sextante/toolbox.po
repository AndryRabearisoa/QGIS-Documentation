msgid "The *Toolbox* is the main element of the SEXTANTE GUI, and the one that you are more likely to use in your daily work. It shows the list of all available algorithms grouped in different blocks, and is the access point to run them whether as a single process or as a batch process involving several executions of a same algorithm on different sets of inputs."

msgid "The toolbox contains all the algorithms available, divided into groups. Each group represents a so-called algorithm provider, which is a set of algorithms coming from the same source, for instance, from a third-party application with geoprocessing capabilities. Some of this groups represent algorithms from one of such third-party applications (like SAGA, GRASS or R), while other contain algorithms directly coded along with SEXTANTE elements, not relying on any additional software. Currently, these providers all reuse code from already-existing QGIS plugins (more specifically, from the *fTools* vector library shiped along with QGIS and the contributed mmqgis plugin that you can install using the plugin manager), making them more useful, since they can be executed from elements such as the modeler or the batch processing interface, which we will soon describe."

An output channel contains the information needed to save the resulting object somewhere. In the most usual case, you will save it to a file, but the architecture of SEXTANTE allows for any other way of storing it. For instance, a vector layer can be stored in a database or even uploaded to a remote server using a WFS-T service. Although solutions like these are not yet implemented, SEXTANTE is prepared to handle them, and we expect to add new kinds of output channels in a near feature."
