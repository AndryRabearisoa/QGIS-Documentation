msgid "The console allows advanced users to increase their productivity and perform complex operations that cannot be performed using any of the other elements of the SEXTANTE GUI. Models involving several algorithms can be defined using the command-line interface, and additional operations such as loops and conditional sentences can be added to create more flexible and powerful workflows."

In fact, some algorithms that you can find in the toolbox, like all the ones in the *mmqgis* group, are simple scripts."

That is done using the ``runalg()`` method, which takes the name of the algorithm to execute as its first parameter, and then a variable number of additional parameter depending on the requirements of the algorithm. So the first thing you need to know is the name of the algorithm to execute. That is not the name you see in the toolbox, but rather a unique commandâ€“line name. To find the right name for your algorithm, you can use the ``algslist()`` method. Type the following line in you console:"
