Imagine you are standing on the top of a hill. Looking down you can see houses, roads, trees, rivers, and so on (see  ). Each one of these things would be a **feature **when we represent them in a GIS Application. Vector features have **attributes**, which consist of text or numerical information that **describe** the features."

msgid "The first thing we need to realise when talking about point features is that what we describe as a point in GIS is a matter of opinion, and often dependent on scale. let's look at cities for example. If you have a small scale map (which covers a large area), it may make sense to represent a city using a point feature. However as you zoom in to the map, moving towards a larger scale, it makes more sense to show the city limits as a polygon."

We are going to go into more detail about Coordinate Reference Systems in a later tutorial. For now let's simply say that a CRS is a way to accurately describe where a particular place is on the earth's surface. One of the most common reference systems is **Longitude and Latitude**. Lines of Longitude run from the North Pole to the South Pole. Lines of Latitude run from the East to West. You can describe precisely where you are at any place on the earth by giving someone your Longitude (X) and Latitude (Y). If you make a similar measurement for a tree or a telephone pole and marked it on a map, you will have created a point feature."

Sometimes we have special rules for polylines in addition to their basic geometry. For example contour lines may touch (e.g. at a cliff face) but should never cross over each other. Similarly, polylines used to store a road network should be connected at intersections. In some GIS applications you can set these special rules for a feature type (e.g. roads) and the GIS will ensure that these polylines always comply to these rules."

msgid "Polygon features are **enclosed areas** like dams, islands, country boundaries and so on. Like polyline features, polygons are created from a series of vertices that are connected with a continuous line. However because a polygon always describes an enclosed area, the first and last vertices should always be at the same place! Polygons often have **shared geometry** â€“ boundaries that are in common with a neighbouring polygon. Many GIS applications have the capability to ensure that the boundaries of neighbouring polygons exactly coincide. We will explore this in the **topology** topic later in this tutorial."

msgid "Now that we have described what vector data is, let's look at how vector data is managed and used in a GIS environment. Most GIS applications group vector features into **layers**. Features in a layer have the the same geometry type (e.g. they will all be points) and the same kinds of attributes (e.g. information about what species a tree is for a trees layer). For example if you have recorded the positions of all the footpaths in your school, they will usually be stored together on the computer hard disk and shown in the GIS as a single layer. This is convenient because it allows you to hide or show all of the features for that layer in your GIS application with a single mouse click."

msgid "The GIS application will allow you to create and modify the geometry data in a layer â€“ a process called **digitising** â€“ which we will look at more closely in a later tutorial. If a layer contains polygons (e.g. farm dams), the GIS application will only allow you to create new polygons in that layer. Similarly if you want to change the shape of a feature, the application will only allow you to do it if the changed shape is correct. For example it won't allow you to edit a line in such a way that it has only one vertex â€“ remember in our discussion of lines above that all lines must have at least two vertices."

Say for example you are monitoring pollution in a river. You could use the GIS to digitise all outfalls for storm water drains (as point features). You could also digitise the river itself (as a polyline feature). Finally you could take readings of pH levels along the course of the river and digitise the places where you made these readings (as a point layer)."

msgid "Map **scale** is an important issue to consider when working with vector data in a GIS. When data is captured, it is usually digitised from existing maps, or by taking information from surveyor records and global positioning system devices. Maps have different scales, so if you import vector data from a map into a GIS environment (for example by digitising paper maps), the digital vector data will have the same scale issues as the original map. This effect can be seen in Illustrations  and  . Many issues can arise from making a poor choice of map scale. For example using the vector data in Illustration  ) to plan a wetland conservation area could result in important parts of the wetland being left out of the reserve! On the other hand if you are trying to create a regional map, using data captured at 1:1000 000 might be just fine and will save you a lot of time and effort capturing the data."

msgid "When you add vector layers to the map view in a GIS application, they will be drawn with random colours and basic symbols. One of the great advantages of using a GIS is that you can create personalised maps very easily. The GIS program will let you choose colours to suite the feature type (e.g. you can tell it to draw a water bodies vector layer in blue). The GIS will also let you adjust the symbol used. So if you have a trees point layer, you can show each tree position with a small picture of a tree, rather than the basic circle marker that the GIS uses when you first load the layer (see Illustrations , &  )."

msgid "At the simplest level we can use vector data in a GIS Application in much the same way you would use a normal topographic map. The real power of GIS starts to show itself when you start to ask questions like 'which houses are within the 100 year flood level of a river?'; 'where is the best place to put a hospital so that it is easily accessible to as many people as possible?'; 'which learners live in a particular suburb?'. A GIS is a great tool for answering these types of questions with the help of vector data. Generally we refer to the process of answering these types of questions as **spatial analysis**. In later topics of this tutorial we will look at spatial analysis in more detail."

msgid "Working with vector data does have some problems. We already mentioned the issues that can arise with vectors captured at different scales. Vector data also needs a lot of work and maintenance to ensure that it is accurate and reliable. Inaccurate vector data can occur when the instruments used to capture the data are not properly set up, when the people capturing the data aren't being careful, when time or money don't allow for enough detail in the collection process, and so on. If you have poor quality vector data, you can often detect this when viewing the data in a GIS. For example **slivers** can occur when the edges of two polygon areas don't meet properly (see  ). **Overshoots** can occur when a line feature such as a road does not meet another road exactly at an intersection. **Undershoots** can occur when a line feature (e.g. a river) does not exactly meet another feature to which it should be connected. demonstrates what undershoots and overshoots look like. Because of these types of errors, it is very important to digitise data carefully and accurately. In the upcoming topic on **topology**, we will examine some of these types of errors in more detail."
