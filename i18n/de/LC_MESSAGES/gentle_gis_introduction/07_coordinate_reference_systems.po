"greater, depending on the level of detail. A globe of this size would be "

"When viewed at close range the earth appears to be relatively flat. However "
"when viewed from space, we can see that the earth is relatively spherical. "
"Maps, as we will see in the upcoming map production topic, are "
"representations of reality. They are designed to not only represent "
"features, but also their shape and spatial arrangement. Each map projection "
"has **advantages** and **disadvantages**. The best projection for a map "
"depends on the **scale** of the map, and on the purposes for which it will "
"be used. For example, a projection may have unacceptable distortions if used "
"to map the entire African continent, but may be an excellent choice for a "
"**large-scale (detailed) map** of your country. The properties of a map "
"projection may also influence some of the design features of the map. Some "
"projections are good for small areas, some are good for mapping areas with a "
"large East-West extent, and some are better for mapping areas with a large "
"North-South extent. **The three families of map projections**"

"The process of creating map projections can be visualised by positioning a "
"light source inside a transparent globe on which opaque earth features are "
"placed. Then project the feature outlines onto a two-dimensional flat piece "
"of paper. Different ways of projecting can be produced by surrounding the "
"globe in a **cylindrical** fashion, as a **cone**, or even as a **flat "
"surface**. Each of these methods produces what is called a **map projection "
"family**. Therefore, there is a family of **planar projections**, a family "

"**Accuracy of map projections**Map projections are never absolutely accurate "
"representations of the spherical earth. As a result of the map projection "
"process, every map shows **distortions of angular conformity, distance and "
"area**. A map projection may combine several of these characteristics, or "
"may be a compromise that distorts all the properties of area, distance and "
"angular conformity, within some acceptable limit. Examples of compromise "
"projections are the** Winkel Tripel projection** and the **Robinson "
"projection** (see  ), which are often used for world maps."

"It is usually impossible to preserve all characteristics at the same time in "
"a map projection. This means that when you want to carry out accurate "
"analytical operations, you need to use a map projection that provides the "
"best characteristics for your analyses. For example, if you need to measure "
"distances on your map, you should try to use a map projection for your data "
"that provides high accuracy for distances.**Map projections with angular "
"conformity**When working with a globe, the main directions of the compass "
"rose (North, East, South and West) will always occur at 90 degrees to one "
"another. In other words, East will always occur at a 90 degree angle to "
"North. Maintaining **correct angular properties** can be preserved on a map "
"projection as well. A map projection that retains this property of angular "
"conformity is called a **conformal or orthomorphic projection**."

"These projections are used when the **preservation of angular "
"relationships** is important. They are commonly used for navigational or "
"meteorological tasks. It is important to remember that maintaining true "
"angles on a map is difficult for large areas and should be attempted only "
"for small portions of the earth. The conformal type of projection results in "
"distortions of areas, meaning that if area measurements are made on the map, "
"they will be incorrect. The larger the area the less accurate the area "
"measurements will be. Examples are the **Mercator projection** (as shown "
"in  ) and the **Lambert Conformal Conic projection**. The U.S. Geological "
"Survey uses a conformal projection for many of its topographic maps.**Map "

"When a map portrays areas over the entire map, so that all mapped areas have "
"the same proportional relationship to the areas on the Earth that they "
"represent, the map is an **equal area map**. In practice, general reference "
"and educational maps most often require the use of **equal area "
"projections**. As the name implies, these maps are best used when "
"calculations of area are the dominant calculations you will perform. If, for "
"example, you are trying to analyse a particular area in your town to find "
"out whether it is large enough for a new shopping mall, equal area "
"projections are the best choice. On the one hand, the larger the area you "
"are analysing, the more precise your area measures will be, if you use an "
"equal area projection rather than another type. On the other hand, an equal "
"area projection results in** distortions of angular conformity** when "
"dealing with large areas. Small areas will be far less prone to having their "
"angles distorted when you use an equal area projection. **Alber's equal "
"area**, **Lambert's equal area** and **Mollweide Equal Area Cylindrical "
"projections** (shown in  ) are types of equal area projections that are "
"often encountered in GIS work.Keep in mind that map projection is a very "
"complex topic. There are hundreds of different projections available world "
"wide each trying to portray a certain portion of the earth's surface as "
"faithfully as possible on a flat piece of paper. In reality, the choice of "
"which projection to use, will often be made for you. Most countries have "
"commonly used projections and when data is exchanged people will follow the "
"**national trend**."

"principles of the three map projection families. Get a globe and paper and "

"With the help of a transparency sheet you can draw a two-dimensional "
"coordinate reference system showing X axes and Y axes. Then, let your pupils "
"define coordinates (x and y values) for different places."
