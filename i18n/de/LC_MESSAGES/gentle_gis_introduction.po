"GIS is becoming an increasingly important tool in environmental management, "
"retail, military, police, tourism and many other spheres of our daily lives. "
"If you use a computer or a cell phone, you have probably already used a GIS "
"in some form without even realising it. Maybe it was a map on a web site, "
"Google Earth, an information booth or your cell phone telling you where you "
"are. Proprietary GIS software (software that cannot be freely shared or "
"modified) is available that will let you do everything we describe in these "
"worksheets and a lot more. However this software is usually very expensive "
"or otherwise limits your freedom to copy, share and modify the software. GIS "
"vendors sometimes make an exception for educational activities, providing "
"cheaper or free copies of their software. They do this knowing that if "
"teachers and learners get to know their software, they will be reluctant to "
"learn other packages. When learners leave school they will go into the "
"workplace and buy the commercial software, never knowing that there are free "
"alternatives that they could be using."

"Raster data is used in a GIS application when we want to display information "
"that is continuous across an area and cannot easily be divided into vector "
"features. When we introduced you to vector data we showed you the image "
"in  . Point, polyline and polygon features work well for representing some "
"features on this landscape, such as trees, roads and building footprints. "
"Other features on a landscape can be more difficult to represent using "
"vector features. For example the grasslands shown have many variations in "
"colour and density of cover. It would be easy enough to make a single "
"polygon around each grassland area, but a lot of the information about the "
"grassland would be lost in the process of simplifying the features to a "
"single polygon. This is because when you give a vector feature attribute "
"values, they apply to the whole feature, so vectors aren't very good at "
"representing features that are not homogeneous (entirely the same) all over. "
"Another approach you could take is to digitise every small variation of "
"grass colour and cover as a separate polygon. The problem with that approach "
"is that it will take a huge amount of work in order to create a good vector "
"dataset."

"Using raster data is a solution to these problems. Many people use raster "
"data as a **backdrop** to be used behind vector layers in order to provide "
"more meaning to the vector information. The human eye is very good at "
"interpreting images and so using an image behind vector layers, results in "
"maps with a lot more meaning. Raster data is not only good for images that "
"depict the real world surface (e.g. satellite images and aerial "
"photographs), they are also good for representing more abstract ideas. For "
"example, rasters can be used to show rainfall trends over an area, or to "
"depict the fire risk on a landscape. In these kinds of applications, each "
"cell in the raster represents a different value. e.g. risk of fire on a "
"scale of one to ten."

"Georeferencing is the process of defining exactly where on the earth's "

"TIN interpolation is another popular tool in GIS. A common TIN algorithm is "
"called **Delaunay** triangulation. It tries to create a surface formed by "
