msgid "GIS is becoming an increasingly important tool in environmental management, retail, military, police, tourism and many other spheres of our daily lives. If you use a computer or a cell phone, you have probably already used a GIS in some form without even realising it. Maybe it was a map on a web site, Google Earth, an information booth or your cell phone telling you where you are. Proprietary GIS software (software that cannot be freely shared or modified) is available that will let you do everything we describe in these worksheets and a lot more. However this software is usually very expensive or otherwise limits your freedom to copy, share and modify the software. GIS vendors sometimes make an exception for educational activities, providing cheaper or free copies of their software. They do this knowing that if teachers and learners get to know their software, they will be reluctant to learn other packages. When learners leave school they will go into the workplace and buy the commercial software, never knowing that there are free alternatives that they could be using."
