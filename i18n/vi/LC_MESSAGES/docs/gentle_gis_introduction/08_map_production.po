msgid "Map production is the process of arranging map elements on a sheet of paper in a way that, even without many words, the average person can understand what it is all about. Maps are usually produced for presentations and reports where the audience or reader is a politician, citizen or a learner with no professional background in GIS. Because of this, a map has to be effective in communicating spatial information. Common elements of a map are the title, map body, legend, north arrow, scale bar, acknowledgement, and map border (see  )."

msgid "Other elements that might be added are e.g. a **graticule**, or **name of the ****map projection** (CRS). Together, these elements help the map reader to interpret the information shown on the map. The map body is, of course, the most important part of the map because it contains the map information. The other elements support the communication process and help the map reader to orientate himself and understand the map topic. For example, the title describes the subject matter and the legend relates map symbols to the mapped data."

msgid "A map is a simplified representation of the real world and **map symbols** are used to represent real objects. Without symbols, we wouldn't understand maps. To ensure that a person can correctly read a map, a map legend is used to provide a key to all the symbols used on the map. It is like a dictionary that allows you to understand the meaning of what the map shows. A map legend is usually shown as a little box in a corner of the map. It contains icons, each of which will represent a type of feature. For example, a *house* icon will show you how to identify houses on the map (see  )."

msgid "**Expressing a scale in words** is a commonly used method and has the advantage of being easily understood by most map users. You can see an example of a word based scale in a . Another option is the **representative fraction (RF)** method, where both the map distance and the ground distance in the real world are given in the same map units, as a ratio. For example, a RF value 1:25,000 means that any distance on the map is 1/25,000*th* of the real distance on the ground (see b ). The value 25,000 in the ratio is called the **scale denominator**. More experienced users often prefer the representative fraction method, because it reduces confusion."

If you look at a topographical map of your town, it would be useful to know when the map was created and who did it. If the map is already 50 years old, you will probably find a lot of houses and roads that no longer exist or maybe never even existed. If you know that the map was created by an official institution, you could contact them and ask if they have a more current version of that map with updated information."
