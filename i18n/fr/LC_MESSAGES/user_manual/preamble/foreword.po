"Welcome to the wonderful world of Geographical Information Systems (GIS)! "
"Quantum GIS (QGIS) is an Open Source Geographic Information System. The "
"project was born in May of 2002 and was established as a project on "
"SourceForge in June of the same year. We've worked hard to make GIS software "
"(which is traditionally expensive proprietary software) a viable prospect "
"for anyone with basic access to a Personal Computer. QGIS currently runs on "
"most Unix platforms, Windows, and OS X. QGIS is developed using the Qt "
"toolkit (http://qt.nokia.com) and C++. This means that QGIS feels snappy to "
"use and has a pleasing, easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI)."

"QGIS aims to be an easy-to-use GIS, providing common functions and features. "
"The initial goal was to provide a GIS data viewer. QGIS has reached the "
"point in its evolution where it is being used by many for their daily GIS "
"data viewing needs. QGIS supports a number of raster and vector data "
"formats, with new format support easily added using the plugin architecture."

"A Geographical Information System (GIS) (Mitchell 2005 :ref:"
"`literature_and_web`) is a collection of software that allows you to create, "
"visualize, query and analyze geospatial data. Geospatial data refers to "
"information about the geographic location of an entity. This often involves "
"the use of a geographic coordinate, like a latitude or longitude value. "
"Spatial data is another commonly used term, as are: geographic data, GIS "
"data, map data, location data, coordinate data and spatial geometry data."

"Applications using geospatial data perform a variety of functions. Map "
"production is the most easily understood function of geospatial "
"applications. Mapping programs take geospatial data and render it in a form "
"that is viewable, usually on a computer screen or printed page. Applications "
"can present static maps (a simple image) or dynamic maps that are customised "
"by the person viewing the map through a desktop program or a web page."

"The recent phenomena of location-based services promises to introduce all "
"sorts of other features, but many will be based on a combination of maps and "
"analysis. For example, you have a cell phone that tracks your geographic "
"location. If you have the right software, your phone can tell you what kind "
"of restaurants are within walking distance. While this is a novel "
"application of geospatial technology, it is essentially doing geospatial "
"data analysis and listing the results for you."

"One type of geospatial data is called raster data or simply \"a raster\". "

"A raster is a regular grid made up of cells, or in the case of imagery, "

"Multiple overlapping rasters are used to represent images using more than "
"one colour value (i.e. one raster for each set of red, green and blue values "
"is combined to create a colour image). Satellite imagery also represents "
"data in multiple \"bands\". Each band is essentially a separate, spatially "
"overlapping raster, where each band holds values of certain wavelengths of "
"light. As you can imagine, a large raster takes up more file space. A raster "
"with smaller cells can provide more detail, but takes up more file space. "
"The trick is finding the right balance between cell size for storage "
"purposes and cell size for analytical or mapping purposes."

"Vector data is also used in geospatial applications. If you stayed awake "
