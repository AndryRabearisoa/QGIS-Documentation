msgid "QGIS has a policy of providing a 'clean application'. Over the years we have had a great many contributors to the project, both in their personal and in an institutional capacity. From time to time we get requests to include logos, about dialogs etc within the application to recognise these contributions. As you can well imagine, if we agreed to every one of these, the application would be extremely cluttered and visually noisy. Instead we try to offer a number of centralised places where these contributors can be acknowledged, as listed above."
