"Map **scale** is an important issue to consider when working with vector "

"When you add vector layers to the map view in a GIS application, they will "

"Working with vector data does have some problems. We already mentioned the "
"issues that can arise with vectors captured at different scales. Vector data "
"also needs a lot of work and maintenance to ensure that it is accurate and "
"reliable. Inaccurate vector data can occur when the instruments used to "
"capture the data are not properly set up, when the people capturing the data "
"aren't being careful, when time or money don't allow for enough detail in "
"the collection process, and so on. If you have poor quality vector data, you "
"can often detect this when viewing the data in a GIS. For example "
"**slivers** can occur when the edges of two polygon areas don't meet "
"properly (see  ). **Overshoots** can occur when a line feature such as a "
"road does not meet another road exactly at an intersection. **Undershoots** "
"can occur when a line feature (e.g. a river) does not exactly meet another "
"feature to which it should be connected. demonstrates what undershoots and "
