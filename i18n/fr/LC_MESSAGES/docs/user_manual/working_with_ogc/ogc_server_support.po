"QGIS Server is an open source WMS 1.3 implementation which, in addition, "
"implements advanced cartographic features for thematic mapping. The QGIS "
"Server is a FastCGI/CGI (Common Gateway Interface) application written in C+"
"+ that works together with a webserver (e.g. Apache, Lighttpd). It is funded "
"by the EU projects Orchestra, Sany and the city of Uster in Switzerland."

"It uses QGIS as backend for the GIS logic and for map rendering. Furthermore "
"the Qt library is used for graphics and for platform independent C++ "
"programming. In contrast to other WMS software, the QGIS Server uses "
"cartographic rules in as a configuration language, both for the server "
"configuration and for the user-defined cartographic rules."

"Moreover, the QGIS Server project provides the 'Publish to Web' plugin, a "

"web project for QGIS Server (containing cartographic visualization rules "

"As QGIS desktop and QGIS Server use the same visualization libraries, the "
"maps that are published on the web look the same as in desktop GIS. The "
"Publish to Web plugin currently supports basic symbolization, with more "
"complex cartographic visualization rules introduced manually. As the "
"configuration is performed with the `SLD standard <http://www.opengeospatial."
"org/standards/sld>`_ and its documented extensions, there is only one "
"standardised language to learn, which greatly simplifies the complexity of "
"creating maps for the Web."
