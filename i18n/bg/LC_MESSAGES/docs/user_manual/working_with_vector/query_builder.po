For example, if you have a ``towns`` layer with a ``population`` field you could select only larger towns by entering ``population > 100000`` in the SQL box of the query builder. Figure_attributes_2_ shows an example of the query builder populated with data from a PostGIS layer with attributes stored in PostgreSQL. The Fields, Values and Operators sections help the user to construct the SQL-like query."

The same function is available from the :guilabel:`General` tab in the vector :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog. You can find a **[Query builder]** button right below. The selection described above can be used with all vector data providers."
