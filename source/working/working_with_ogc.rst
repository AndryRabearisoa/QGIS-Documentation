Working with OGC Data
---------------------

QGIS supports WMS and WFS as data sources. 


What is OGC Data
================

.. index:: Open_Geospatial_Consortium, OGC

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), is an international organization
with more than 300 commercial, governmental, nonprofit and research
organizations worldwide. Its members develop and implement standards for
geospatial content and services, GIS data processing and exchange.

Describing a basic data model for geographic features an increasing number
of specifications are developed to serve specific needs for interoperable
location and geospatial technology, including GIS. Further information
can be found under http://www.opengeospatial.org/.

.. index:: WMS, WFS, WCS, CAT, SFS, GML

Important OGC specifications are:

* **WMS** --- Web Map Service
* **WFS** --- Web Feature Service
* **WCS** --- Web Coverage Service
* **CAT** --- Web Catalog Service
* **SFS** --- Simple Features for SQL
* **GML** --- Geography Markup Language

OGC services are increasingly being used to exchange geospatial data between
different GIS implementations and data stores.  QGIS can now deal with
three of the above specifications, being SFS (through support of the
PostgreSQL / PostGIS data provider, see Section :ref:`label_postgis`),
WFS and WMS as a client.

.. _`ogc-wms`:

WMS Client
==========

.. index:: WMS_client


.. _`ogc-wms-about`:

Overview of WMS Support
***********************

QGIS currently can act as a WMS client that understands WMS 1.1, 1.1.1
and 1.3 servers. It has particularly been tested against publicly
accessible servers such as DEMIS and JPL OnEarth.

.. NASA JPL OnEarth does not exist anymore

WMS servers act upon requests by the client (e.g. QGIS) for a raster map
with a given extent, set of layers, symbolization style, and transparency.
The WMS server then consults its local data sources, rasterizes the map,
and sends it back to the client in a raster format. For QGIS this would
typically be JPEG or PNG.

WMS is generically a REST (Representational State Transfer) service rather
than a fully-blown Web Service. As such, you can actually take the URLs
generated by QGIS and use them in a web browser to retrieve the same images
that QGIS uses internally. This can be useful for troubleshooting, as there
are several brands of WMS servers in the market and they all have their
own interpretation of the WMS standard.

WMS layers can be added quite simply, as long as you know the URL to access
the WMS server, you have a serviceable connection to that server, and the
server understands HTTP as the data transport mechanism.

.. _`ogc-wms-servers`:

Selecting WMS Servers
*********************


The first time you use the WMS feature, there are no servers defined. 

Begin by clicking the |mActionAddWmsLayer| :sup:`Add WMS layer`
button inside the toolbar, or through the 
:menuselection:`Layer --> Add WMS Layer...` menu.

The dialog :guilabel:`Add Layer(s) from a Server` for adding layers from
the WMS server appears. You can add some servers to play with
by clicking the **[Add default servers]** button. This will add two 
WMS demo servers for you to use, the WMS servers of the DM Solutions Group and Lizardtech. 
To define a new WMS server in the tab :guilabel:`Layers`, select the
**[New]** button. Then enter the parameters to connect to your desired
WMS server, as listed in table_OGC_1_:

.. _table_OGC_1:

+--------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Name                                 | A name for this connection.  This name will be used in the     |

|                                      | it from other WMS Servers.                                     |
+--------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| URL                                  | URL of the server providing the data. This must be a resolvable|

+--------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
Table OGC 1: WMS Connection Parameters 

.. index:: Proxy, proxy-server

If you need to set up a proxy-server to be able to receive WMS-services
from the internet, you can add your proxy-server in the options. Choose
menu :menuselection:`Settings --> Options` and click on the tab 
:guilabel:`Network & Proxy`. There you can add your proxy-settings and enable them by
setting the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Use proxy for web access`. Make sure that you select
the correct proxy-type from the :menuselection:`Proxy type` dropdown menu.

Once the new WMS Server connection has been created, it will be preserved
for future QGIS sessions.


.. tip:: **On WMS Server URLs**
   
   Be sure, when entering in the WMS server URL, that you have the base URL.
   For example, you shouldn't have fragments such as ``request=GetCapabilities``
   or ``version=1.0.0`` in your URL.

.. _`ogc-wms-layers`:

Loading WMS Layers
******************


Once you have successfully filled in your parameters you can select the
**[Connect]** button to retrieve the capabilities of the selected
server. This includes the Image encoding, Layers, Layer Styles and
Projections. Since this is a network operation, the speed of the response
depends on the quality of your network connection to the WMS server. While
downloading data from the WMS server, the download progress is visualized
in the left bottom of the WMS Plugin dialog.

.. following should be replaced in 1.8 with the response of de DM Solutions Group

Your screen should now look a bit like figure_OGR_1_, which
shows the response provided by the NASA JPL OnEarth WMS server.

.. _figure_OGR_1:
.. figure:: img/en/connection_wms.png
   :align: center
   :width: 45em

   Figure OGR 1: Dialog for adding a WMS server, showing its available layers |nix|

Image Encoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Image encoding` section now lists the formats that are supported
by both the client and server. Choose one depending on your image accuracy
requirements.

.. tip:: **Image Encoding**
   
   You will typically find that a WMS server offers you the choice of JPEG
   or PNG image encoding. JPEG is a lossy compression format, whereas PNG
   faithfully reproduces the raw raster data.

   Use JPEG if you expect the WMS data to be photographic in nature and/or
   you don't mind some loss in picture quality. This trade-off typically
   reduces by 5 times the data transfer requirement compared to PNG.

   Use PNG if you want precise representations of the original data, and you
   don't mind the increased data transfer requirements.

Options
~~~~~~~

The Options field provides a text-field where you can add a layer name
for the WMS-layer. This name will be presented in the legend after loading
the layer.

Below the layer name you find the default projection, provided by the
mapserver. If the **[Change...]** button is active, you can click
on it and change the default projection of the WMS to another CRS,
provided by the WMS server.

Layer Order
~~~~~~~~~~~

The tab :guilabel:`Layer Order` lists the selected layers available from the
current connected WMS server. You may notice that some layers are expandable,
this means that the layer can be displayed in a choice of image styles.

You can select several layers at once, but only one image style per layer.
When several layers are selected, they will be combined at the WMS Server
and transmitted to QGIS in one go.


.. tip:: **WMS Layer Ordering**
  
   WMS layers rendered by a server are overlaid
   in the order listed in the Layers section, from top to bottom of the
   list. If you want to change the overlay order, you can use the
   tab :guilabel:`Layer Order`.

.. _`ogc-wms-transparency`:

Transparency
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this version of QGIS, the transparency setting is hard-coded to be
always on, where available.

.. index:: WMS_layer_transparency

.. tip:: **WMS Layer Transparency**
  
  The availability of WMS image transparency depends on the image encoding
  used: PNG and GIF support transparency, whilst JPEG leaves it unsupported.

Coordinate Reference System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: Coordinate_Reference_System, SRS, CRS

A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is the OGC terminology for a QGIS
Projection.

Each WMS Layer can be presented in multiple CRSs, depending on the
capability of the WMS server. You may notice that the *x* changes in the
*Coordinate Reference System (x available)* header as you select and
deselect layers from the :guilabel:`Layers section` tab.

To choose a CRS, select **[Change...]** and a dialog similar to
:ref:`figure_projection_2` in :ref:`label_projstart` will appear.
The main difference with the WMS version of the screen is that only
those CRSs supported by the WMS Server will be shown.

.. tip:: **WMS Projections**
   
   For best results, make the WMS layer the first layer you add to your
   project. This allows the project projection to inherit the CRS you used
   to render the WMS layer. On-the-fly projection (see :ref:`projection-specifying`)
   can then be used to fit any subsequent vector layers to the project
   projection. In this version of QGIS, if you add a WMS layer later, and
   give it a different CRS to the current project projection, unpredictable
   results can occur.

.. _`serversearch`:

Server-Search
*************

Within QGIS you can search for WMS-servers. Figure_OGC_2_ shows
the tab :guilabel:`Search` with the :guilabel:`Add Layer(s) from a
Server` dialog.

.. _Figure_OGC_2:
.. figure:: img/en/wms_server_search.png
   :align: center
   :width: 38em

   Figure OGC 2: Dialog for searching WMS servers after some keywords |nix|

As you can see it is possible to enter a search-string in the text field
and hit the :guilabel:`Search` button.

After a short while the search result will be populated into the tab below
the text field.

Browse the result list and inspect your search results within the table.
To visualize the results, select a table entry, press the :guilabel:`Add
selected row to WMS-list` button and change back to the tab :guilabel:`Server`.

QGIS automatically has updated your server list and the selected search
result is already enabled in the list of saved WMS-servers.

You only need to request the list of layers by clicking the
**[Connect]** button.

This option is quite handy when you want to search maps by specific
keywords.

Basically this option is a frontend to the API of http://geopole.org.

.. _`tilesets`:

Tilesets
********

.. index:: WMS_tiles, WMS-C

When using WMS-C (Cached WMS) Services like
http://labs.metacarta.com/wms-c/Basic.py you are able to browse through
the tab :guilabel:`Tiles` given by the server. Additional information like
tile size, formats and supported CRS are listed in this table.

In combination with this feature you can use the tile scale slider from
the :menuselection:`View --> Tile scale slider`, which gives you the
available scales from the tileserver with nice slider docked in.

.. _`ogc-wms-identify`:

Using the Identify Tool
***********************

.. index:: WMS_identify

Once you have added a WMS server, and if any layer from a WMS server is
queryable, you can then use the |mActionIdentify| :sup:`Identify`
tool to select a pixel on the map canvas. A query is made to the WMS
server for each selection made.

The results of the query are returned in plain text. The formatting of
this text is dependent on the particular WMS server used.

.. _`ogc-wms-properties`:

Viewing Properties
------------------

.. index:: WMS_properties

Once you have added a WMS server, you can view its properties by
right-clicking on it in the legend, and selecting :menuselection:`Properties`.

.. _`ogc-wms-properties-metadata`:

Metadata Tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. index:: WMS_metadata

The tab :guilabel:`Metadata` displays a wealth of information about the WMS
server, generally collected from the Capabilities statement returned from
that server.

Many definitions can be gleaned by reading the 
`WMS standards <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms/>`_, 
but here are a few handy definitions:

* **Server Properties**
 - **WMS Version** --- The WMS version supported by the server.
 - **Image Formats** --- The list of MIME-types the server can respond
   with when drawing the map.  QGIS supports whatever formats the
   underlying Qt libraries were built with, which is typically at least
   ``image/png`` and ``image/jpeg``.
 - **Identity Formats** --- The list of MIME-types the server can respond
   with when you use the Identify tool.  Currently QGIS supports the
   ``text-plain`` type.

* **Layer Properties**
 - **Selected** --- Whether or not this layer was selected when its 
   server was added to this project.
 - **Visible** --- Whether or not this layer is selected as visible in
   the legend. (Not yet used in this version of QGIS.)
 - **Can Identify** --- Whether or not this layer will return any results
   when the Identify tool is used on it.
 - **Can be Transparent** --- Whether or not this layer can be rendered
   with transparency. This version of QGIS will always use transparency
   if this is ``Yes`` and the image encoding supports transparency
 - **Can Zoom In** --- Whether or not this layer can be zoomed in by the
   server. This version of QGIS assumes all WMS layers have this set to
   ``Yes``. Deficient layers may be rendered strangely.
 - **Cascade Count** --- WMS servers can act as a proxy to other WMS
   servers to get the raster data for a layer.  This entry shows how many
   times the request for this layer is forwarded to peer WMS servers for
   a result.
 - **Fixed Width, Fixed Height** --- Whether or not this layer has fixed
   source pixel dimensions. This version of QGIS assumes all WMS layers
   have this set to nothing. Deficient layers may be rendered strangely.
 - **WGS 84 Bounding Box** --- The bounding box of the layer, in WGS 84
   coordinates. Some WMS servers do not set this correctly (e.g. UTM
   coordinates are used instead). If this is the case, then the initial
   view of this layer may be rendered with a very ``zoomed-out`` appearance
   by QGIS. The WMS webmaster should be informed of this error, which
   they may know as the WMS XML elements ``LatLonBoundingBox``,
   ``EX_GeographicBoundingBox`` or the CRS:84 ``BoundingBox``.
 - **Available in CRS** --- The projections that this layer can be rendered
   in by the WMS server. These are listed in the WMS-native format.
 - **Available in style** --- The image styles that this layer can be
   rendered in by the WMS server.

.. _`ogc-wms-limits`:

WMS Client Limitations
**********************


Not all possible WMS Client functionality had been included in this version
of QGIS. Some of the more notable exceptions follow.

Editing WMS Layer Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Once you've completed the |mActionAddWmsLayer| :sup:`Add WMS layer`
procedure, there is no ability to change the settings.

A workaround is to delete the layer completely and start again.

WMS Servers Requiring Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Currently public accessible and secured WMS-services are supported.
The secured WMS-servers can be accessed by public authentication. You
can add the (optional) credentials when you add a WMS-server. See section
:ref:`ogc-wms-servers` for details.

.. index:: InteProxy, Secured_OGC_Authentication

.. tip:: **Accessing secured OGC-layers**
  
   If you need to access secured layers with other secured methods than
   basic authentication, you could use InteProxy as a transparent proxy,
   which does support several authentication methods. More information can
   be found at the InteProxy-manual found on the website
   http://inteproxy.wald.intevation.org.

.. index:: QGIS_mapserver, WMS_1.3.0

.. tip:: **QGIS WMS Mapserver**

   From Version 1.7.0 QGIS has its own implementation of
   a WMS 1.3.0 Mapserver. Read more about this at chapter :ref:`label_qgisserver`.

.. _`ogc-wfs`:

WFS and WFS-T Client
====================

.. index:: WFS, WFS-T, WFS_Transactional

In QGIS, a WFS layer behaves pretty much like any other vector layer. You
can identify and select features and view the attribute table. Since QGIS
1.6 editing (WFS-T) is also supported.

In general adding a WFS layer is very similar to the procedure used with WMS. 
The difference is there are no default servers defined, so we have to add our own.

Loading a WFS Layer
-------------------

As an example we use the DM Solutions WFS server and display a layer.
The URL is: http://www2.dmsolutions.ca/cgi-bin/mswfs_gmap

#. Click on the |wfs| :sup:`Add WFS Layer` tool on the
   Layers toolbar, the dialog :guilabel:`Add WFS Layer from a Server` appears
#. Click on **[New]**
#. Enter ``DM Solutions`` as name
#. Enter the URL (see above)
#. Click **[OK]**
#. Choose :guilabel:`Server Connections DM Solutions` |selectstring| from the dropdown box
#. Click **[Connect]**
#. Wait for the list of layers to be populated
#. select the :guilabel:`Parks` layer in the list
#. Click **[Apply]** to add the layer to the map

Note that proxy-settings you have set in your preferences are also recognized.

.. _figure_OGC_3:
.. figure::img/en/connection_wfs.png
   :align: center
   :width: 34 em

   Figure OGC 3: Adding a WFS layer |nix|

.. in QGIS 1.8 the following checkbox seems to be missing, maybe the
   loading of features is allready prevented by default when it is not
   the first layer loaded? This needs to be checked..

Without using the checkbox |checkbox| 
:guilabel:`Only request features overlapping the current view extent` 
QGIS fetches all features from the WFS-server. If you
only want to have a small selection based on your extent, zoom to the area
of interest, request the WFS-layer again and make sure you have checked
the checkbox mentioned above. Basically this adds the BBOX-parameter with
the values from your current extent to the WFS-query. This is extremely
useful when you only want to request **some** features from a huge
WFS-dataset.

You'll notice the download progress is visualized in the left bottom of
the QGIS main window. Once the layer is loaded, you can identify and
select a province or two and view the attribute table.

Adding WFS layers works best with MapServer WFS servers. It still
could be, that you might experience random behavior and crashes. You can
look forward to improvements in a future version of the plugin.

This means that only WFS 1.0.0 is supported. At this point there have not
been many tests against WFS versions implemented in other WFS-servers.
If you encounter problems with any other WFS-server, please do not
hesitate to contact the development team. Please refer to Section
:ref:`label_helpsupport` for further information about the mailinglists.


.. tip:: **Finding WFS Servers**
  
   You can find additional WFS servers by using Google or your favorite
   search engine. There are a number of lists with public URLs, some of
   them maintained and some not.

.. tip:: **Accessing secure WFS Servers**

   Within the dialog :guilabel:`Create a new WFS-connection` QGIS does not
   support authenticated WFS-connections yet. Within one of the next releases
   we expect to also support authenticated WFS-servers. Meanwhile you could
   use InteProxy (http://inteproxy.wald.intevation.org) for accessing
   authenticated WFS-servers.
