Print Composer
--------------

The print composer provides growing layout and printing capabilities. It
allows you to add elements such as the QGIS map canvas, legend, scalebar,
images, basic shapes, arrows and text labels. You can size, group, align
and position each element and adjust the properties to create your layout.
The layout can be printed or exported to image formats, Postscript, PDF
or to SVG [1]_ and you can save the layout as template and load it again
in another session. See a list of tools in :ref:`table_printcomposer_tools`:

All Print Composer tools are available in menus and as icons in a toolbar.
The toolbar can be switched off and on using the right mouse button holding
the mouse over the toolbar.

Open a new Print Composer Template
==================================

Before you start to work with the print composer, you need to load some
raster and vector layers in the QGIS map canvas and adapt their properties
to suite your own convenience. After everything is rendered and symbolized
to your liking you click the |mActionNewComposer| :guilabel:`New Print
Composer` icon in the toolbar or choose :menuselection:`File --> New Print
Composer`.

Using Print Composer
====================

.. _figure_composer_1:
.. figure:: img/en/print_composer_blank.png
   :align: center
   :width: 40em

   Figure Composer 1: Print Composer |nix|

Opening the print composer provides you with a blank canvas to which you
can add the current QGIS map canvas, legend, scalebar, images, basic
shapes, arrows and text. Figure_composer_1_ shows the initial
view of the print composer with an activated |checkbox| Snap to grid mode
but before any elements are added. The print composer provides three tabs:

* The |tab| General tab allows you to set paper size, orientation, the
  print quality for the output file in dpi and to activate snapping to a
  grid of a defined resolution. Please note, the |checkbox| Snap to grid
  feature only works, if you define a grid resolution > 0. Furthermore you
  can also activate the |checkbox| Print as raster checkbox. This means all
  elements will be rastered before printing or saving as Postscript of PDF.
* The |tab| Item tab displays the properties for the selected map element.
  Click the |mActionSelectPan| :guilabel:`Select/Move item` icon to select
  an element (e.g. legend, scalebar or label) on the canvas. Then click the
  |tab| Item tab and customize the settings for the selected element.
* The |tab| Command history tab displays a history of all changes applied
  to the print composer layout. With a mouse click it is possible to undo
  and redo layout steps back and forth to a certain status.

You can add multiple elements to the composer. It is also possible to have
more than one map view or legend or scalebar in the print composer canvas.
Each element has its own properties and in the case of the map, its own
extent. If you want to remove an elements from the composer canvas. you can
do that with the kbd:`Delete` or the :kbd:`Backspace` key.

Adding a current QGIS map canvas to the Print Composer
======================================================

To add the QGIS map canvas, click on the |mActionAddMap| :guilabel:`Add
new map from QGIS map canvas` button in the print composer toolbar and
drag a rectangle on the composer canvas with the left mouse button to
add the map. To display the current map, you can choose between three
different modes in the map |tab| Item tab:

* |selectstring| Preview Rectangle is the default setting. It only
  displays an empty box with a message **Map will be printed here**.
* |selectstring| Preview Cache renders the map in the current screen
  resolution. If case you zoom in or out the composer window, the map is
  not rendered again but the image will be scaled.
* |selectstring| Preview Render means, that if you zoom in or out the
  composer window, the map will be rendered again, but for space reasons,
  only up to a maximum resolution.

**Cache** is default preview mode for newly added print composer maps.

You can resize the map element by clicking on the
|mActionSelectPan| :guilabel:`Select/Move item` button, selecting the
element, and dragging one of the blue handles in the corner of the map.
With the map selected, you can now adapt more properties in the map
|tab| Item tab.

To move layers within the map element select the map element, click
the |mActionMoveItemContent| :guilabel:`Move item content` icon and move
the layers within the map element frame with the left mouse button. After
you found the right place for an element, you can lock the element position
within the print composer canvas. Select the map element and click on the
right mouse button to |mIconLock| :guilabel:`Lock` the element position
and again to unlock the element. You can lock the map element also
activating the |checkbox| Lock layers for map item checkbox in the Map
dialog of the Map Item tab.

**Note:** QGIS \CURRENT is now able to show labels from the new labeling
plugin also in the map composer, but it is not yet scaled correctly. So it
might be necessary to switch back to the standard labeling in some cases.

Raise or lower functionalities for elements are inside the |mActionRaiseItems|
:guilabel:`Raise selected items` pulldown menu. Choose an element on the
print composer canvas and select the matching functionality to raise or
lower the selected element compared to the other elements (see table
`printcomposer_tools`_).

There are several alignment functionalities available within the
|mActionAlignLeft| :guilabel:`Align selected items` pulldown menu (see
table `printcomposer_tools`_). To use an alignment functionality , you
first select some elements and then click on the matching alignment icon.
All selected will then be aligned within to their common bounding box.

Creating Output
===============

Figure `print_composer_complete`_ shows the print composer with an example
print layout including each type of map element described in the sections
above.

   Print Composer with map view, legend, scalebar, coordinates and text added |nix|

The print composer allows you to create several output formats and it is
possible to define the resolution (print quality) and paper size:

* The |mActionFilePrint| :guilabel:`Print` icon allows to print the layout
  to a connected printer or a Postscript file depending on installed printer
  drivers.
* The |mActionExportMapServer| :guilabel:`Export as image` icon exports
  the composer canvas in several image formats such as PNG, BPM, TIF, JPG,...
* The |mActionSaveAsPDF| :guilabel:`Export as PDF` saves the defined
  print composer canvas directly as a PDF.
* The |mActionSaveAsSVG| :guilabel:`Export as SVG` icon saves the print
  composer canvas as a SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic). **Note:** Currently
  the SVG output is very basic. This is not a QGIS problem, but a problem
  of the underlaying Qt library. This will hopefully be sorted out in
  future versions.

Saving and loading a print composer layout
==========================================

With the |mActionFileSaveAs| :guilabel:`Save as template` and
|mActionFolder| :guilabel:`Load from template` icons you can save the
current state of a print composer session as a  *.qpt template and load
the template again in another session.

The  |mActionComposerManager| :guilabel:`Composer Manager` button in the
toolbar and in :menuselection:`File --> Composer Manager` allows to
add a new composer template or to manage already existing templates.
