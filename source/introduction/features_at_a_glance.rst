After a first and simple sample session in Section :ref:`label.getstarted` we now
want to give you a more detailed overview of the features of QGIS.  Most 
features presented in the following chapters will be explained and described in
their own sections later in the manual.

.. _`label_startingqgis`:

Starting and Stopping QGIS
===========================

In Section :ref:`samplesession` you already learned how to start QGIS. We will
repeat this here and you will see that QGIS also provides further command line 
options.

* |nix| Assuming that QGIS is installed in the PATH, you can start QGIS
  by typing: ``qgis``  at a command prompt or by double clicking on the QGIS
  application link (or shortcut) on the desktop or in the application menu.
* |win| Start QGIS using the Start menu or desktop shortcut,
  or double click on a QGIS project file.
* |osx| Double click the icon in your Applications folder. If you need to 
  start QGIS in a shell, run 
  /path-to-installation-executable/Contents/MacOS/Qgis.


To stop QGIS, click the menu options |nix| |win| :menuselection:`File` |osx| 
:menuselection:`QGIS --> Quit`, or use the shortcut :kbd:`Ctrl+Q`.

.. _`label_commandline`:

Command Line Options
--------------------

:index:`command line options`

|nix| QGIS supports a number of options when started from the command line. To
get a list of the options, enter ``qgis ---help`` on the command line.
The usage statement for QGIS is:

::

	qgis --help
	Quantum GIS - 1.7.0-Wroclaw 'Wroclaw' (exported)
	Quantum GIS (QGIS) is a viewer for spatial data sets, including
	raster and vector data.
	Usage: qgis [options] [FILES]
	  options:
	        [--snapshot filename]           emit snapshot of loaded datasets to given file
	        [--width width]                 width of snapshot to emit
	        [--height height]               height of snapshot to emit
	        [--lang language]               use language for interface text
	        [--project projectfile]         load the given QGIS project
	        [--extent xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax]  set initial map extent
	        [--nologo]                      hide splash screen
	        [--noplugins]                   don't restore plugins on startup
	        [--optionspath path]            use the given QSettings path
	        [--configpath path]             use the given path for all user configuration
	        [--help]                        this text

	  FILES:
	    Files specified on the command line can include rasters,
	    vectors, and QGIS project files (.qgs):
	     1. Rasters - Supported formats include GeoTiff, DEM
	        and others supported by GDAL
	     2. Vectors - Supported formats include ESRI Shapefiles
	        and others supported by OGR and PostgreSQL layers using
	        the PostGIS extension

.. tip::
	**Example Using command line arguments**
	You can start QGIS by specifying one or more data files
	on the command line. For example, assuming you are in the
	qgis_sample_data directory, you could start QGIS with a vector layer
	and a raster file set to load on startup using the following command:
	``qgis ./raster/landcover.img ./gml/lakes.gml``

**Command line option** ``---snapshot``


This option allows you to create a snapshot in PNG format from the current view.
This comes in handy when you have a lot of projects and want to
generate snapshots from your data.

Currently it generates a PNG-file with 800x600 pixels. This can be adapted
using the ``---width`` and ``---height`` command line
arguments. A filename can be added after ``---snapshot``.

**Command line option** ``---lang``


Based on your locale QGIS, selects the correct localization. If you would like
to change your language, you can specify a language code. For example:
``---lang=it``
starts QGIS in italian localization. A list of currently supported
languages with language code and status is provided at
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/GUI_Translation_Progress

**Command line option** ``---project``


Starting QGIS with an existing project file is also possible. Just
add the command line option ``---project`` followed by your project
name and QGIS will open with all layers loaded described in the given file.

**Command line option** ``---extent``


To start with a specific map extent use this option. You need to add the 
bounding box of your extent in the following order separated by a comma::

    --extent xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax

**Command line option** ``---nologo``


This command line argument hides the splash screen when you start QGIS.

**Command line option** ``---noplugins``


If you have trouble at startup with plugins, you can avoid loading them at startup. 
They will still be available in Plugins Manager after-wards.

**Command line option** ``---optionspath``

You can have multiple configurations and decide which one to use when starting 
QGIS using this option. See :ref:`subsec_gui_options` to check where does the 
operating system save the settings files. Presently there is no way to specify 
in which file where to write the settings, therefore you can create a copy of 
the original settings file and rename it.

**Command line option** ``---configpath``


This option is similar to the one above, but furthermore overrides the default 
path (~/.qgis) for user configuration and forces QSettings to use this directory, 
too. This allows users to e.g. carry QGIS installation on a flash drive together 
with all plugins and settings

QGIS GUI
========

.. :index:`main window`

When QGIS starts, you are presented with the GUI as shown below
(the numbers 1 through 6 in yellow ovals refer to the six major areas of the
interface as discussed below):

.. _fig_startup:

.. figure:: img/en/startup.png
   :align: center
   :width: 45em

   QGIS GUI with Alaska sample data (KDE)

.. note:: 
   Your window decorations (title bar, etc.) may appear
   different depending on your operating system and window manager.

The QGIS GUI is divided into six areas:

+--------------+-----------------+
|1. Menu Bar   | 4. Map View     |
+--------------+-----------------+
|2. Tool Bar   | 5. Map Overview |
+--------------+-----------------+
|3. Map Legend | 6. Status Bar   |
+--------------+-----------------+

These six components of the QGIS interface are described in more detail in
the following sections. Two more sections present keyboard shortcuts and
context help.

.. _label_menubar:

Menu Bar
---------

.. index::`menus`

The menu bar provides access to various QGIS features using a standard
hierarchical menu. The top-level menus and a summary of some of the
menu options are listed below, together with the icons of the corresponding
tools as they appear on the toolbar, as well as keyboard
shortcuts. [1]_
Although most menu options have a corresponding tool and vice-versa,
the menus are not organized quite like the toolbars.
The toolbar containing the tool is listed after each menu option as a checkbox
entry. For more information about tools and toolbars, see Section
:ref:`label_toolbars`.

.. See Appendix :ref:`app_menu` for complete descriptions of the menu items.

.. _`label_toolbars`:

Toolbars
--------

.. index::`toolbars`

The toolbars provide access to most of the same functions as the menus,
plus additional tools for interacting with the map. Each toolbar item has
popup help available. Hold your mouse over the item and a short description of
the tool's purpose will be displayed.

Every menubar can be moved around according to your needs. Additionally every
menubar can be switched off using your right mouse button context menu holding
the mouse over the toolbars.

.. index::`layout!toolbars`

.. tip::
   **Restoring toolbars** 

   If you have accidentally hidden all your toolbars, you can get them
   back by choosing menu option :menuselection:`Settings --> Toolbars -->`.

.. _`label_legend`:

Map Legend
-----------

.. index::`legend`

The map legend area lists all the layers in the project.
The checkbox in each legend entry can be used to show or hide the layer 
 .. index::`layer!visibility`
A layer can be selected and dragged up or down in the legend to change the
z-ordering. Z-ordering means that layers listed nearer the top of the legend are
drawn over layers listed lower down in the legend.

Layers in the legend window can be organised into groups. To do so, right click
in the legend window and choose :menuselection:`Add group -->`. Type in a name for the
group and press :kbd:`Enter`. Now click on an existing layer and drag it
onto the group. Also, if new layers are added to the project while a group is
selected, they will automatically be placed in the group.

To bring a layer out of a group you can drag it out, or right click on it and 
choose :menuselection:`Make to toplevel item -->`. Groups can be nested inside other groups.

The checkbox for a group will show or hide all the layers in the group
with one click.

The content of the right mouse button context menu depends on whether the selected 
legend item is a raster or a vector layer. For GRASS vector layers 
:menuselection:`toggle editing -->` is not available. See section 
:ref:`grass_digitising` for information on editing GRASS vector layers.

* **Right mouse button menu for raster layers**

  * :menuselection:`Zoom to layer extent -->`
  * :menuselection:`Zoom to best scale (100 %) -->`
  * :menuselection:`Show in overview -->`
  * :menuselection:`Remove -->`
  * :menuselection:`Properties -->`
  * :menuselection:`Rename -->`
  * :menuselection:`Add Group -->`
  * :menuselection:`Expand all -->`
  * :menuselection:`Collapse all -->`

.. *  :menuselection:`Show file groups`

* **Right mouse button menu for vector layers**

  * :menuselection:`Zoom to layer extent -->`
  * :menuselection:`Show in overview -->`
  * :menuselection:`Remove -->`
  * :menuselection:`Open attribute table -->`
  * :menuselection:`Toggle editing (not available for GRASS layers) -->`
  * :menuselection:`Save as -->`
  * :menuselection:`Save selection as -->`
  * :menuselection:`Query -->`
  * :menuselection:`Properties -->`
  * :menuselection:`Rename -->`
  * :menuselection:`Add Group -->`
  * :menuselection:`Expand all -->`
  * :menuselection:`Collapse all -->`

.. * :menuselection:`Make to toplevel item`
.. * :menuselection:`Show file groups`

* **Right mouse button menu for layer groups**

  * :menuselection:`Zoom to group -->`
  * :menuselection:`Remove -->`
  * :menuselection:`Set group CRS -->`
  * :menuselection:`Rename -->`
  * :menuselection:`Add Group -->`
  * :menuselection:`Expand all -->`
  * :menuselection:`Collapse all -->`

.. *  :menuselection:`Show file groups`


It is possible to select more than one Layer or Group at the same time 
by holding down the :kbd:`Ctrl`-Key while selecting the Layers with the 
left mouse button. You can then move all selected Layers to a new Group at 
the same time.

You are also able to delete more than one Layer or Group at once by selecting 
several Layers with the :kbd:`Ctrl` - Key and pressing :kbd:`Ctrl D` afterwards.
This way all selected Layers or Groups will be removed from the Layerlist.


.. _`label_mapview`:

Map View
--------

.. index::`map view`

This is the 'business end' of QGIS - maps are displayed in this area! The
map displayed in this window will depend on the vector and raster layers you
have chosen to load (see sections that follow for more information on how to
load layers). The map view can be panned (shifting the focus of the map display
to another region) and zoomed in and out. Various other operations can be
performed on the map as described in the toolbar description above.  The map
view and the legend are tightly bound to each other - the maps in view reflect
changes you make in the legend area.

.. tip::
   **Zooming the Map with the Mouse Wheel**

   .. index::`zoom mouse wheel`
   You can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out on the map. Place
   the mouse cursor inside the map area and roll the wheel forward (away from 
   you) to zoom in and backwards (towards you) to zoom out. The mouse cursor 
   position is the center where the zoom occurs. You can customize the behavior 
   of the mouse wheel zoom using the :menuselection:`Map tools` tab under 
   the :menuselection:`Settings --> Options` menu.

.. tip::
   **Panning the Map with the Arrow Keys and Space Bar**
   
   .. index::`pan!arrow keys`
   You can use the arrow keys to pan in the map. Place the mouse cursor
   inside the map area and click on the right arrow key to pan East, left arrow
   key to pan West, up arrow key to pan North and down arrow key to pan South.
   You can also pan the map using the space bar: just move the mouse while
   holding down space bar.

.. _`label_mapoverview`:

Map Overview 
------------

.. index::`Map overview`

The map overview panel provides a full extent view of layers added to it. It
can be selected under the menu :menuselection:`Settings --> Panels`.
Within the view is a rectangle showing the current map extent. This allows
you to quickly determine which area of the map you are currently viewing. Note
that labels are not rendered to the map overview even if the layers in the
map overview have been set up for labeling.

You can add a single layer to the overview by right-clicking on it in the
legend and select |checkbox| Show in overview. You can also add layers to,
or remove all layers from the overview using the Overview tools on the toolbar.

If you click and drag the red rectangle in the overview that shows your
current extent, the main map view will update accordingly.

.. _`label_statusbar`:

Status Bar
----------

The status bar shows you your current position in map coordinates (e.g.
meters or decimal degrees) as the mouse pointer is moved across the map view.
To the left of the coordinate display in the status bar is a small button that
will toggle between showing coordinate position or the view extents of the
map view as you pan and zoom in and out.

A progress bar in the status bar shows progress of rendering
as each layer is drawn to the map view. In some cases, such as the gathering
of statistics in raster layers, the progress bar will be used to show the
status of lengthy operations.

If a new plugin or a plugin update is available, you will see a message in the
status bar. On the right side of the status bar is a small
checkbox which can be used to temporarily prevent layers being rendered to the
map view (see Section :ref:`redraw_events` below). The icon |mIconStopRendering| 
immediately stops the current map rendering process. 

At the far right of the status bar you find the EPSG code of the current 
project CRS and a projector icon. Clicking on this opens the projection properties 
for the current project.

.. tip::
   **Calculating the correct Scale of your Map Canvas**

   .. index::`Scale calculate`
   When you start QGIS, degrees is the default unit, and it tells QGIS
   that any coordinate in your layer is in degrees. To get correct scale values,
   you can either change this to meter manually in the :guilabel:`General` tab under
   :menuselection:`Settings -->` :menuselection:`Project Properties -->` or you can 
   select a project Coordinate Reference System (CRS) clicking on the
   |mIconProjectionDisabled| :sup:`CRS status` icon in the lower right-hand corner of 
   the statusbar. In the last case, the units are set to what the project 
   projection specifies, e.g. '+units=m'.

.. _`shortcuts`:

Keyboard shortcuts
-------------------

.. index::`Keyboard shortcuts`

QGIS provides default keyboard shortcuts for many features. You find them in
Section :ref:`label_menubar` below. Additionally the menu option 
:menuselection:`Settings -->` :menuselection:`Configure Shortcuts -->` allows to 
change the default keyboard shortcuts and to add new keyboard shortcuts to QGIS 
features.

.. _shortcuts:

.. figure:: img/en/shortcuts.png 
   :align: center
   :width: 30em

   Define shortcut options |nix| (KDE)

Configuration is very simple. Just select a feature from the list and click
on **[Change]**, **[Set none]** or **[Set default]**. Once you 
have found your configuration, you can save it as XML file and load it to another
QGIS installation.

.. _`context_help`:

Context help
------------

.. index::`Context help`

When you need help on a specific topic, you can access context help via the 
:guilabel:`Help` button available in most dialogs - please note that third-party 
plugins can point to dedicated web pages.

.. _`redraw_events`:

Rendering
===========
.. index::`Rendering`

By default, QGIS renders all visible layers whenever the map canvas must be
refreshed. The events that trigger a refresh of the map canvas include:

*  Adding a layer
*  Panning or zooming
*  Resizing the QGIS window
*  Changing the visibility of a layer or layers

QGIS allows you to control the rendering process in a number of ways.

.. `label_scaledepend`:

Scale Dependent Rendering
-------------------------
.. index::`Rendering scale dependent`

Scale dependent rendering allows you to specify the minimum and maximum
scales at which a layer will be visible.  To set scale dependency rendering,
open the :guilabel:`Properties` dialog by double-clicking on the layer in the
legend. On the :guilabel:`General` tab, set the minimum and maximum scale values and 
then click on the |checkbox|:guilabel:`Use scale dependent rendering` checkbox.

You can determine the scale values by first zooming to the level you want
to use and noting the scale value in the QGIS status bar.

.. index::`Scale`

.. _`label_controlmap`:

Controlling Map Rendering 
-------------------------

Map rendering can be controlled in the following ways:

.. _`label_suspendrender`:

**a) Suspending Rendering**

.. index::`rendering!suspending`

To suspend rendering, click the |checkbox| Render checkbox in the lower right
corner of the statusbar. When the |checkbox| Render box is not checked, QGIS
does not redraw the canvas in response to any of the events described in
Section :ref:`redraw_events`. Examples of when you might want to suspend
rendering include:

* Add many layers and symbolize them prior to drawing
* Add one or more large layers and set scale dependency before drawing
* Add one or more large layers and zoom to a specific view before drawing
* Any combination of the above

Checking the |checkbox| Render box enables rendering and causes an immediate
refresh of the map canvas.

.. _`label_settinglayer`:

**b) Setting Layer Add Option** 


.. index::`rendering!options`
.. index::`layers!initial visibility`

You can set an option to always load new layers without drawing them. This
means the layer will be added to the map, but its visibility checkbox in the
legend will be unchecked by default. To set this option, choose
menu option :menuselection:`Settings --> Options -->` and click on the
:guilabel:`Rendering` tab. Uncheck the |checkbox| :guilabel:`By default new layers 
added to the map should be displayed` checkbox. Any layer added to the map will 
be off (invisible) by default.

**Stopping Rendering**

.. index::`Rendering halting`

.. _`label_stoprender`

To stop the map drawing, press the ESC key. This will halt the refresh of
the map canvas and leave the map partially drawn. It may take a bit of time
between pressing ESC and the time the map drawing is halted.
 
.. note::
   It is currently not possible to stop rendering - this was disabled 
   in qt4 port because of User Interface (UI) problems and crashes.

.. _`label_updatemap`:

**c) Updating the Map Display During Rendering**


.. index::`rendering!update during drawing`

You can set an option to update the map display as features are drawn. By
default, QGIS does not display any features for a layer until the entire
layer has been rendered. To update the display as features are read from the
datastore, choose menu option :menuselection:`Settings --> Options -->`
click on the :guilabel:`Rendering` tab. Set the feature count to an
appropriate value to update the display during rendering. Setting a value of 0
disables update during drawing (this is the default). Setting a value too low
will result in poor performance as the map canvas is continually updated
during the reading of the features. A suggested value to start with is 500.

.. _`label_renderquality`:

**d) Influence Rendering Quality**


.. index::`rendering!quality`

To influence the rendering quality of the map you have 3 options. Choose menu
option :menuselection:`Settings --> Options -->` click on the :guilabel:`Rendering` tab and select or deselect following checkboxes.


* |checkbox| :guilabel:`Make lines appear less jagged at the expense of some 
  drawing performance`
* |checkbox| :guilabel:`Fix problems with incorrectly filled polygons`

.. _`sec_measure`:

Measuring 
==========
.. index::`measure`

Measuring works within projected coordinate systems (e.g., UTM) and 
unprojected data. If the loaded map is defined with a geographic coordinate system
(latitude/longitude), the results from line or area measurements will be
incorrect. To fix this you need to set an appropriate map coordinate system
(See Section :ref:`label_projections`). All measuring modules also use the
snapping settings from the digitizing module. This is useful, if you want to
measure along lines or areas in vector layers.

To select a measure tool click on |mActionMeasure| and select the tool you want 
to use.

Measure length, areas and angles
---------------------------------

.. index::`measure:line length`
.. index::`measure:areas`
.. index::`measure:angles`

|mActionMeasure| QGIS is able to measure real distances between given points 
according to a defined ellipsoid. To configure this, choose menu option
:menuselection:`Settings --> Options -->`, click on the :guilabel:`Map tools` tab and 
choose the appropriate ellipsoid. There you can also define a rubberband color 
and your preferred measurement units (meters or feet) and angle units (degrees, 
radians and gon). The tools then allows you to click points on the map. Each 
segment-length as well as the total shows up in the measure-window. To stop 
measuring click your right mouse button. 

|mActionMeasureArea| Areas can also be measured.  In the measure window the 
accumulated area-size appears. In addition, the measuring tool will snap to the 
currently selected layer, provided that layer has its snapping tolerance set. 
(See Section :ref:`snapping_tolerance`).  So if you want to measure exactly along 
a line feature, or around a polygon feature, first set its snapping tolerance, 
then select the layer. Now, when using the measuring tools, each mouse click 
(within the tolerance setting) will snap to that layer. 

|mActionMeasureAngle| You can also measure angles, selecting Measure Angle tool. 
The cursor becomes cross-shaped. Click to draw the first segment of the angle you 
wish to measure, then move the the cursor to draw the desired angle. The measure
is displayed in a popup dialog.

.. _measure_in_action:

+------------------------+------------------------+
| |measure_line|         | |measure_angle|        |

Measure tools in action


.. _`sec_selection`:

Select and deselect features 
-----------------------------


The QGIS toolbar provides several tools to select features in the map canvas. 
To select one or several features just click on 
|mActionSelect| and select your tool:

* |mActionSelect| :sup:`Select features`
* |mActionSelectRectangle| :sup:`Select features by rectangle`
* |mActionSelectPolygon| :sup:`Select features by polygon`
* |mActionSelectFreehand| :sup:`Select features by freehand`
* |mActionSelectRadius| :sup:`Select features by radius`

To deselect all selected features click on |mActionDeselectAll|.

.. _sec_projects:

Projects
=========
.. index::`projects`

The state of your QGIS session is considered a Project.  QGIS
works on one project at a time.  Settings are either considered
as being per-project, or as a default for new projects (see
Section :ref:`subsec_gui_options`). QGIS can save the state of your
workspace into a project file using the menu options
:menuselection:`File -->` |mActionFileSave| :guilabel:`Save Project`
or :menuselection:`File -->` |mActionFileSaveAs| :guilabel:`Save Project As`.

Load saved projects into a QGIS session using
:menuselection:`File -->` |mActionFileOpen| :guilabel:`Open Project`
or :menuselection:`File --> Open Recent Project`.

If you wish to clear your session and start fresh, choose
:menuselection:`File -->` |mActionFileNew| :guilabel:`New Project`.
Either of these menu options will prompt you to save the existing project
if changes have been made since it was opened or last saved.

The kinds of information saved in a project file include:

* Layers added
* Layer properties, including symbolization
* Projection for the map view
* Last viewed extent

The project file is saved in XML format, so it is possible to edit
the file outside QGIS if you know what you are doing. The file format
was updated several times compared to earlier QGIS versions. Project files
from older QGIS versions may not work properly anymore. To be made aware of this,
in the :guilabel:`General` tab under :menuselection:`Settings --> Options`
you can select: 

 |checkbox| :guilabel:`Prompt to save project changes when required`
 |checkbox| :guilabel:`Warn when opening a project file saved with an older 
 version of QGIS`

**Project Properties**


In the properties window for the project under |nix| :menuselection:`File -->
Project Properties` or |win| :menuselection:`Settings -->
Project Properties` you set project specific options. These
include:

* In the :guilabel:`General` tab the project title, selection and background
  color, layer units, precision, and the option to save relative paths to
  layers can be defined. You can define the layer units (only used when CRS 
  transformation is disabled) and the precision of decimal places to use.  
* The :guilabel:`CRS Coordinate Reference System` tab enables you to choose 
  the CRS for this project, and to enable on-the-fly re-projection of raster and 
  vector layers when displaying layers from a different CRS.
* With the third :guilabel:`Identifiable layers` tab you set (or disable) 
  which layers will respond to the identify tool. (See the Map tools paragraph from
  the :ref:`gui_options` section to enable identifying of multiple layers.)
* The tab :guilabel:`WMS Server` allows to define information about the QGIS 
  mapserver Service Capabilities, the Extent and the CRS Restrictions. Activating 
  the |checkbox| :guilabel:`Add WKT geometry to feature info response` will allow 
  to query the WMS layers.

.. _`sec_output`:

Output 
=======

.. index::`output!save as image!print composer!quick print`

There are several ways to generate output from your QGIS session. We have
discussed one already in Section :ref:`sec_projects` saving as a project file.
Here is a sampling of other ways to produce output files:

* Menu option |mActionSaveMapAsImage| :menuselection:`Save as Image` opens
  a file dialog where you select the name, path and type of image (PNG or JPG
  format). A world file with extension PNGW or JPGW saved in the same folder
  georeferences the image.
* Menu option |mActionNewComposer| :menuselection:`New Print Composer` opens a
  dialog where you can layout and print the current map canvas (see
  Section :ref:`label_printcomposer`).

.. _subsec_gui_options:

GUI Options 
=============


|mActionOptions| Some basic options for QGIS can be selected using the :guilabel:`Options` dialog. Select the menu option :menuselection:`Settings -->` |mActionOptions| :menuselection:`Options`. The tabs where you can optimize your options are:

please refer to the manual of the underlying QT-library-documentation at
http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/qnetworkproxy.html#ProxyType-enum.

.. tip::
   **Using Proxies**

   Using proxies can sometimes be tricky. It is useful to 'trial and
   error' the above proxy types and check if they succeed in your case.

You can modify the options according to your needs. Some of the changes may
require a restart of QGIS before they will be effective.

* |nix| settings are saved in a texfile: \$HOME/.config/QuantumGIS/qgis.conf
* |osx| you can find your settings in: 
  \$HOME/Library/Preferences/org.qgis.qgis.plist
* |win| settings are stored in the registry under:
::

   \\HKEY\CURRENT_USER\Software\QuantumGISqgis


.. _`sec_annotations`:

.. index::
   single: annotation

Annotation Tools 
================


The |mActionTextAnnotation| text annotation tools in the attribute t oolbar 
provides the possibility to place formatted text in a balloon on the QGIS map 
canvas. Use the text annotation tool and click into the map canvas.

.. _annotation:

.. figure:: img/en/annotation.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30em

   Annotation text dialog |nix| 

Double click on the item opens a dialog with various options. There is the
text editor to enter the formatted text and other item settings. E.g. there
is the choice of having the item placed on a map position (displayed by
a marker symbol) or to have the item on a screen position (not related
to the map). The item can be moved by map position (drag the map marker)
or by moving only the balloon. The icons are part of gis theme, and are used
by default in the other themes too.

The |mActionAnnotation| move annotation tool allows to move the annotation on the 
map canvas.

**Form annotations**

.. index::`annotations`
.. index::`form annotation|\see{annotations}`

Additionally you can also create your own annotation forms. The
|mActionFormAnnotation| form annotation tool is useful to display attributes of 
a vector layer in a customized qt designer form (see Figure :ref:`fig:custom-annotations`). It is similar to the
designer forms for the identify tool, but displayed in an annotation item.
Also see QGIS blog http://blog.qgis.org/node/143 for more information.

.. _custom_annotation:

.. figure:: img/en/custom_annotation.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30em

   Customized qt designer annotation form |nix| 

.. note::
   If you press :kbd:`Ctrl+T` while an annotation tool is active 
   (move annotation, text annotation, form annotation), the visibility states 
   of the items are inverted.

.. _`sec_bookmarks`:

Spatial Bookmarks
==================

.. index::`bookmarks`
.. index::`spatial bookmarks|\see{bookmarks}`

Spatial Bookmarks allow you to "bookmark" a geographic location and return to 
it later.

Creating a Bookmark
-------------------

To create a bookmark:

#. Zoom or pan to the area of interest.
#. Select the menu option :menuselection:`View --> New Bookmark -->` or press :kbd:`Ctrl-B`.
#. Enter a descriptive name for the bookmark (up to 255 characters).
#. Click **[OK]** to add the bookmark or **[Cancel]** to exit without adding the bookmark.



Note that you can have multiple bookmarks with the same name.

Working with Bookmarks
-----------------------

To use or manage bookmarks, select the menu option 
:menuselection:`View --> Show Bookmarks -->`. The 
:menuselection:`Geospatial Bookmarks` dialog allows you to zoom to or delete a 
bookmark. You can not edit the bookmark name or coordinates.

Zooming to a Bookmark
----------------------

From the :menuselection:`Geospatial Bookmarks` dialog, select the desired 
bookmark by clicking on it, then click **[Zoom To]**.
You can also zoom to a bookmark by double-clicking on it.

Deleting a Bookmark
-------------------

To delete a bookmark from the :guilabel:`Geospatial Bookmarks`
dialog, click on it then click **[Delete]**.
Confirm your choice by clicking **[Yes]** or cancel the
delete by clicking **[No]**.

.. _`sec_gpstracking`:

Live GPS tracking
==================


To activate Live GPS tracking in QGIS you need to select :menuselection:`View --> Live GPS tracking -->` . You will get a new docked Window on 
the left side of the canvas.

There are 4 possible screens in this GPS tracking window
(see Figure :ref:`fig:gpstrack_liv` and Figure :ref:`fig:gpstrack_options`).

* |mActionToggleEditing| GPS position coordinates and for manually entering 
  Vertices and Features.
* |gpstrack_barchart| GPS signal strength of satellite connections.
* |gpstrack_polarchart| GPS polar screen showing number and polar position of 
  satellites.
* |mActionOptions| GPS options screen (see Figure :ref:`fig:gpstrack_options`).

With a plugged in GPS receiver (has to be supported by your operating system)
a simple click on **[Connect]** connects the GPS to QGIS. 
A second click (now **[Disconnect]**) disconnects the 
GPS-Receiver from your Computer. For GNU/Linux gpsd support is integrated to 
support connection to most GPS receivers. Therefore you first have to configure 
gpsd properly to connect QGIS to it.

.. warning::
   If you want to record your position to the canvas you have to
   create a new vector layer first and switch it to editable status to be able 
   to record your track.

Position coordinates
---------------------

|mActionToggleEditing| If the GPS is
receiving signals from satellites you will see your position in latitude,
longitude and elevation as you can see in Figure :ref:`table_figure_gps_tracking`.

GPS signal strength
--------------------

|gpstrack_barchart| Here you can see
the signal strenght of the satellites you are receiving signals from
Figure :ref:`gpstrack_stren`.

GPS polar window
----------------

|gpstrack_polarchart| If you want
to know where in the sky all the connected satellites are, you have to
switch to the polar screen (Figure :ref:`gpstrack_polar`).
You can also see the ID numbers of the satellites you are receiving signals from.

GPS options
------------

|mActionOptions| In case of connection problems you can switch from 
|radiobuttonon| :menuselection:`Autodetect` to |radiobuttonon| 
:menuselection:`Use path/port below` and select the path/port your GPS receiver 
is connected to.  A click on **[Connect]** again initiates 
the connection to the GPS receiver.

With the slider :menuselection:`GPS Cursor Size` |slider| you can shrink and grow 
the position cursor on the canvas. Activating |radiobuttonon| 
:menuselection:`Auto-add vertices` within GPS digitizing your track will 
automatically be recorded in the active vector layer (of course the layer has to 
be in edit mode).

With GPS map recenter you can decide in which way the canvas will be
updated if your recorded coordinates start either to move out of canvas
or there is any change at all.

Track color and width sets the color of and the width of your drawn track.

If you want to set a feature manually you have to go back to
|mActionToggleEditing| "Position Coordinates"
and click on **[Add feature]**.

.. [1] Keyboard shortcuts can now be configured manually
   (shortcuts presented in this section are the defaults), using the Configure
   Shortcuts tool under Settings Menu.
