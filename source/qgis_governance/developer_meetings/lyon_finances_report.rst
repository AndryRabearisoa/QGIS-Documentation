* expenses

  - HF

    - 2011 Lisbon	4,400 €
    - 2011 Zuerich	6,400 €
    - 2012 Lyon	(?)	7,500 €

* Japanese gold sponsor

Problems
--------

* costs are rising more than incomes

  - still positive balance though

* handling of donations cumbersome (by hand)
* accounting is more complex than we would like

  - some of the expenses are paid directly by local sponsors

* fiscal requests: sponsoring receipt for tax office

Proposals
---------

* split the functions of Treasurer (Horst) and PSC

  - more formal annual and HF budgets

* automatic handling of donations, e.g.

  - http://www-old.gnome.org/friends/
  - http://documentfreedom.org/donate/

* *QGIS friendly* courses
* money from OSGEO (GSoC)?
* from Otto: a wiki page with:

  - tasks
  - developer (with contact address)
  - amount requested
  - list of people willing to donate
