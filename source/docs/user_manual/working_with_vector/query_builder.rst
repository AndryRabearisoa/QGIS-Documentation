Query Builder
=============

The Query Builder allows you to define a subset of a table using a SQL-like WHERE clause and display the result 
in the main window. The query result then can be saved as a new vector layer.

Query
-----

Open the attribute table choosing |mActionOpenTable| :menuselection:`Open Attribute Table` from the menu bar.
Click on the **[Advanced Search]** button to open the query builder.
For example, if you have a ``towns`` layer with a ``population`` field you could select only larger towns 
by entering ``population > 100000`` in the SQL box of the query builder. 
Figure_attributes_2_ shows an example of the query builder populated with data 
from a PostGIS layer with attributes stored in PostgreSQL. The Fields, Values 
and Operators sections help the user to construct the SQL-like query.

The **Fields list** contains all attribute columns of the attribute table to be 
searched. To add an attribute column to the SQL where clause field, double click its 
name in the Fields list. Generally you can use the various fields, values and 
operators to construct the query or you can just type it into the SQL box.

The **Values list** lists the values of an attribute table. To list all possible 
values of an attribute, select the attribute in the Fields list and click 
the **[all]** button. To list the first 25 unique values of an attribute column, 
select the attribute column in the Fields list and click the 
**[Sample]** button. To add a value to the SQL where clause field, double 
click its name in the Values list.

The **Operators section** contains all usable operators. To add an operator 
to the SQL where clause field, click the appropriate button. Relational 
operators ( = , > , ...), string comparison operator ( LIKE ), logical 
operators ( AND , OR, ...) are available.

The **[Test]** button shows a message box with the number of features 
satisfying the current query, which is usable in the process of query 
construction. The **[Clear]** button clears the text in the SQL where 
clause text field. The **[Save]** and **[Load]** button allow to save 
and load SQL queries. The **[OK]** button closes the window and selects 
the features satisfying the query. The **[Cancel]** button closes the 
window without changing the current selection.


.. _tip_sql_layer_definition:

.. tip:: **Changing the Layer Definition**

   You can change the layer definition after it is loaded by altering the 
   SQL query used to define the layer. To do this, open the vector 
   :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog by double-clicking on the layer in 
   the legend and click on the **[Query Builder]** button on the 
   :guilabel:`General` tab. See Section :ref:`vector_properties_dialog` for 
   more information.

.. _sec_selection_query:

Selection
---------

With |qg| it is possible also to select features for visualisation using a similar query 
builder interface to that used in :ref:`vector_query_builder`. In the above 
section the purpose of the query builder is to highlight all selected features meeting 
the filter criteria in yellow. The rest of the features do not change their appearance.

Another possibility is to make a selection by right clicking on a layer in the legend and 
choosing :guilabel:`Query ...`. If you perform a SQL query here only the selected features are 
displayed in the map view. Features that don't match the SQL query are not visualised in the map view.
The same function is available from the :guilabel:`General` tab in the vector :guilabel:`Layer Properties` dialog. 
You can find a **[Query builder]** button right below. 
The selection described above can be used with all vector data providers.


Save selected features as new layer
-----------------------------------

The selected features can be saved as any OGR supported vector format and 
also transformed into another Coordinate Reference System (CRS). Just open 
the right mouse menu of the layer and click on 
:menuselection:`Save selection as -->` to define the name of the output file, 
its format and CRS (see Section :ref:`label_legend`). It is also possible to 
specify OGR creation options within the dialog.
