Delimited Text Plugin
=========================================
    

The Delimited Text plugin allows you to load a delimited text file as a layer in QGIS. 

**Requirements**



To view a delimited text file as layer, the text file must contain:
    
#. A delimited header row of field names. This must be the first line in the text file.
#. The header row must contain an X and Y field. These fields can have any name.
#. The x and y coordinates must be specified as a number. The coordinate system is not important.


As an example of a valid text file we import the elevation point data file 
:file:`elevp.csv` coming with the QGIS sample dataset (See Section :ref:`label_sampledata`):

::
 
 X;Y;ELEV
 -300120;7689960;13
 -654360;7562040;52
 1640;7512840;3
 [...]


Some items of note about the text file are:


#. The example text file uses ; as delimiter. Any character can be 
   used to delimit the fields.
#. The first row is the header row. It contains the fields X, Y and ELEV.
#. No quotes (") are used to delimit text fields.
#. The x coordinates are contained in the X field.
#. The y coordinates are contained in the Y field.



**Using the Plugin**


To use the plugin you must first enable it as described in Section 
:ref:`managing_plugins`.

Click the new toolbar icon |delimited_text| :sup:`Add Delimited Text Layer` 
to open the Delimited Text dialog as shown in figure_delimited_text_1_.

.. _figure_delimited_text_1:

First select the file (e.g., :file:`qgis_sample_data/csv/elevp.csv`) to 
import by clicking on the **[Browse]** button. Once the file is selected, 
the plugin attempts to parse the file using the last used delimiter, in this 
case a semi-colon (;). To properly parse the file, it 
is important to select the correct delimiter. To change the delimiter to tab use 
\\t (this is a regular expression for the tab character).

Once the file is parsed, choose the X and Y fields from the drop down lists and 
if available also the WKT field for the CRS information. Finally enter a Layer 
name (e.g., :file:`elevp` ) as shown in figure_delimited_text_1_ . To add the 
layer to the map, click **[OK]**. The delimited text file now behaves as any 
other map layer in QGIS.
