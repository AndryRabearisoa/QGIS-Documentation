Offline Editing Plugin

For data collection, it is a common situation to work with a laptop or a cell 
phone offline in the field. Upon returning to the network, the changes need to 
be synchronized with the master data source, e.g. a PostGIS database. If several 
persons are working simultaneously on the same datasets, it is difficult to 
merge the edits by hand, even if people donâ€™t change the same features.

The |offline_editing_copy|:sup:`Offline Editing` Plugin automates the synchronisation by copying the content of a datasource (usually PostGIS or WFS-T) to a spatialite database and storing the offline edits to dedicated tables. After being connected to the network again, it is possible to apply the offline edits to the master dataset.

**Using the plugin**

*  Open some vector layers, e.g. from a PostGIS or WFS-T datasource
*  Save it as a project
*  Press the 'Convert to offline project' button and select the layers to 
   save. The content of the layers is saved to spatialite tables.
*  Edit the layers offline.
*  After being connected again, upload the changes with the 'Synchronize' button.
