msgid "Several methods are used to display elevation layers and give a 3D effect to maps. The use of contour lines as shown above is one popular method often chosen to produce topographic maps. Another way to display a 3D effect is by hillshading. The hillshade effect is created from a DEM (elevation) raster by first calculating the slope and aspect of each cell, then simulating the sun's position in the sky and giving a reflectance value to each cell. Thus you get sun facing slopes lighted and the slopes facing away from the sun (in shadow) are darkened."
