msgid "|qg| requires that PostgreSQL layers contain a column that can be used as a unique key for the layer. For tables this usually means that the table needs a primary key, or a column with a unique constraint on it. In |qg|, this column needs to be of type int4 (an integer of size 4 bytes). Alternatively the ctid column can be used as primary key. If a table lacks these items, the oid column will be used instead. Performance will be improved if the column is indexed (note that primary keys are automatically indexed in PostgreSQL)."
