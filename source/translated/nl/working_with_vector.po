"Most of the time |qg| should simply provide you with a list of database "

"|qg| requires that PostgreSQL layers contain a column that can be used as a "
"unique key for the layer. For tables this usually means that the table needs "
"a primary key, or a column with a unique constraint on it. In |qg|, this "
"column needs to be of type int4 (an integer of size 4 bytes). Alternatively "
"the ctid column can be used as primary key. If a table lacks these items, "
"the oid column will be used instead. Performance will be improved if the "
"column is indexed (note that primary keys are automatically indexed in "
"PostgreSQL)."

"If the PostgreSQL layer is a view, the same requirement exists, but views do "
"not have primary keys or columns with unique constraints on them. In this "
"case |qg| will try to find a column in the view that is derived from a "

"However there are several aspects of SQL that |qg| ignores these include the "
"use of table aliases and columns that are generated by SQL functions."
