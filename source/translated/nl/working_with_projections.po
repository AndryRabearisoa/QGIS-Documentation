"QGIS allows users to define a global and project-wide CRS (Coordinate "
"Reference System) for layers without a pre-defined CRS. It also allows the "
"user to define custom coordinate reference systems and supports on-the-fly "
"(OTF) projection of vector and raster layers. All these features allow the "

"QGIS has support for approximately 2,700 known CRS. Definitions for each of "
"these CRS are stored in a SQLite database that is installed with QGIS. "
"Normally you do not need to manipulate the database directly. In fact, doing "
"so may cause projection support to fail. Custom CRS are stored in a user "
"database. See Section :ref:`sec:customprojections` for information on "
"managing your custom coordinate reference systems."

"In order to use OTF projection, your data must contain information about its "
"coordinate reference system or you have to define a global, layer or project-"
"wide CRS. For PostGIS layers QGIS uses the spatial reference identifier that "
"was specified when the layer was created. For data supported by OGR, QGIS "
"relies on the presence of a recognized means of specifying the CRS. In the "
"case of shapefiles, this means a file containing the Well Known Text (WKT):"
"index:`WKT` specification of the CRS. This projection file has the same base "
"name as the shapefile and a prj extension. For example, a shapefile named :"
"file:`alaska.shp` would have a corresponding projection file named :file:"
