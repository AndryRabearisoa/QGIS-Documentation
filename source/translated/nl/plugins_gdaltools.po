"The GDAL Tools plugin offers a GUI to the collection of tools in the "
"Geospatial Data Abstraction Library, http://gdal.osgeo.org . These are "
"raster management tools to query, re-project, warp, merge a wide variety of "
"raster formats. Also included are tools to create a contour (vector) layer, "
"or a shaded relief from a raster DEM, and to make a vrt (Virtual Raster Tile "
"in XML format) from a collection of one or more raster files. These tools "
"are available when the plugin is installed and activated."
