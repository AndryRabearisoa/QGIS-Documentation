"QGIS Server is an open source WMS 1.3 implementation which, in addition, "
"implements advanced cartographic features for thematic mapping. The QGIS "
"Server is a FastCGI/CGI (Common Gateway Interface) application written in C+"
"+ that works together with a webserver (e.g. Apache, Lighttpd). It is funded "
"by the EU projects Orchestra, Sany and the city of Uster in Switzerland."

"It uses QGIS as backend for the GIS logic and for map rendering. Furthermore "
"the Qt library is used for graphics and for platform independent C++ "
"programming. In contrast to other WMS software, the QGIS Server uses "
"cartographic rules in SLD/SE as a configuration language, both for the "
"server configuration and for the user-defined cartographic rules."

"Moreover, the QGIS Server project provides the 'Publish to Web' plugin, a "
"plugin for QGIS desktop which exports the current layers and symbology as a "
"web project for QGIS Server (containing cartographic visualization rules "
"expressed in SLD)."

"As QGIS desktop and QGIS Server use the same visualization libraries, the "
"maps that are published on the web look the same as in desktop GIS. The "
"Publish to Web plugin currently supports basic symbolization, with more "
"complex cartographic visualization rules introduced manually. As the "
"configuration is performed with the SLD standard and its documented "
"extensions, there is only one standardised language to learn, which greatly "
"simplifies the complexity of creating maps for the Web."
