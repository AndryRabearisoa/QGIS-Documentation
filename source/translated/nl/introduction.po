"A Geographical Information System (GIS) ([1]) is a collection of software "
"that allows you to create, visualize, query and analyze geospatial data. "
"Geospatial data refers to information about the geographic location of an "
"entity. This often involves the use of a geographic coordinate, like a "
"latitude or longitude value. Spatial data is another commonly used term, as "
"are: geographic data, GIS data, map data, location data, coordinate data and "
"spatial geometry data."

"Applications using geospatial data perform a variety of functions. Map "
"production is the most easily understood function of geospatial "
"applications. Mapping programs take geospatial data and render it in a form "
"that is viewable, usually on a computer screen or printed page. Applications "
"can present static maps (a simple image) or dynamic maps that are customised "
"by the person viewing the map through a desktop program or a web page."

"The recent phenomena of location-based services promises to introduce all "

"analysis. For example, you have a cell phone that tracks your geographic "

"of restaurants are within walking distance. While this is a novel "
"application of geospatial technology, it is essentially doing geospatial "
"data analysis and listing the results for you."

"What is new is how the latest hardware and software is being applied and who "
"is applying it. Traditional users of mapping and analysis tools were highly "
"trained GIS Analysts or digital mapping technicians trained to use CAD-like "

"(OSS) packages have enabled an army of hobbyists, professionals, web "
"developers, etc. to interact with geospatial data. The learning curve has "
"come down. The costs have come down. The amount of geospatial technology "

"One type of geospatial data is called raster data or simply \"a raster\". "
"The most easily recognised form of raster data is digital satellite imagery "
"or air photos. Elevation shading or digital elevation models are also "
"typically represented as raster data. Any type of map feature can be "
"represented as raster data, but there are limitations."

"A raster is a regular grid made up of cells, or in the case of imagery, "
"pixels. They have a fixed number of rows and columns. Each cell has a "
"numeric value and has a certain geographic size (e.g. 30x30 meters in size)."

"Multiple overlapping rasters are used to represent images using more than "
"one colour value (i.e. one raster for each set of red, green and blue values "
"is combined to create a colour image). Satellite imagery also represents "
"data in multiple \"bands\". Each band is essentially a separate, spatially "
"overlapping raster, where each band holds values of certain wavelengths of "
"light. As you can imagine, a large raster takes up more file space. A raster "
"with smaller cells can provide more detail, but takes up more file space. "
"The trick is finding the right balance between cell size for storage "
"purposes and cell size for analytical or mapping purposes."

"Vector data is also used in geospatial applications. If you stayed awake "
"during trigonometry and coordinate geometry classes, you will already be "
"familiar with some of the qualities of vector data. In its simplest sense, "
"vectors are a way of describing a location by using a set of coordinates. "
"Each coordinate refers to a geographic location using a system of x and y "
"values."
